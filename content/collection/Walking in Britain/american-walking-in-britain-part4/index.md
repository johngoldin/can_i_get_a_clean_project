## Finding Your Way

For the official long-distance routes on the coast, navigation is
easy. Just keep the ocean to your left 
(or right, depending on your general heading).
And yet on the first day of setting out from Padstow on
the South West Coast Path I managed to follow
a finger post that said "SWCP" that pointed in
the direction opposite from my intended direction.
It's hard to explain how I did that. I won't bore you
with a long paragraph on how I turned myself around.
The point is that it's possible to get off track.

My most important piece of advice is don't be over confident
and assume you know where you are. When in doubt, check.
You're on foot so if you continue in an incorrect direction it
can take you a long time to fix your mistake. Better to notice
quickly that you are off your intended route and do something
about it sooner rather than later. So how do you know where
you are and whether you are on track?

### Maps

The Ordnance Survey is the government organization that does 
maps for the UK. 
OS paper maps are widely available in bookstores and local shops.
The OS Explorer series is aimed at walkers. The scale is 
very tight: 4cm on the map is equal to 1km in the real world 
(a scale of 1:25000). 

A paper map at that scale turns out
to be fairly bulky and unwieldy. I confess I have almost never
used the 1:25K scale OS maps. 
Instead on multi-day walks I have relied on [Harvey Maps](http://www.harveymaps.co.uk), 
whose slogan is "a good week's walking on one map".
Harvey maps are available for the national trails and some
popular long routes. The scale is 1:40K rather
than 1:25K. There's enough detail to find your way,
but it's easier to get the map unfolded so that you 
can see the spot you need. They are printed on
waterproof paper, a good feature for a map you plan
to need for a week.

The Ordnance Survey also offers the OS Landranger series, which is
useful for walks but with less detail and less paper. At a 
scale of 1:50K you can see a much larger area for a given
size of paper. It's not as detailed as the 
Explorer maps, but it's generally good enough to help
you find your way. If you are spending a lot of time
in a location not covered by a Harvey map,
the Explorer maps are a good alternative.

#### Maps on Your Phone


To find your way using a paper map you need to locate where you are on the 
map. One attractive feature of a map on your phone is
that the GPS can show you where you are on the map.

The Ordnance Survey offers access to their maps on Android or iPhone
via their OS Maps app. My most recent holiday in the UK
was in 2019 before this app was released
so I used other electronic aids,
primarily [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com)
on my iPhone and a Garmin GPS (or SatNav in Britspeak) 
loaded with Open Street Map for the UK obtained
via an outfit called [Talkytoaster](https://shop.talkytoaster.me.uk/product/tt-150k-look-n-feel-map-for-self-install-automatic-delivery-british-isles-only-dem).
For my next trip I expect to rely on the Ordnance Survey OS Maps app.
Access is by subscription, but you can get a 
one-month premium access for £3.99, which is a good deal.
By comparison, a single Landranger paper maps costs £8.99.

The app mimics the appearance of the paper
Ordnance Survey maps. If you are looking at a wider
area, the format follows the Landranger series (where
the paper maps show a scale of 1:50K). As you zoom in,
the format changes to the Explorer maps (designed
for a scale of 1:25K).

Here are two screenshots of OS Maps displaying the
area where the Two Moors Way passes through the town of
Ivybridge and enters Dartmoor. The first version shows
the Landranger style and the second zooms into a smaller area
and shows Explorer style. It's a bit disconcerting when
the style changes suddenly as one zooms in using the app, 
but it's not bothersome.

</figure>
      
  
Unfortunately the details of the legends are different
on the two separate map formats. For example, 
on Landranger a long distance trail such as the
Two Moors Way is marked with red diamonds 
while on Explorer it appears as
green diamonds. On Landranger contour lines are in
red while on Explorer they are more of a brown color.
It's not too bad. Your brain will sort it out almost
automatically. The important thing is that when you zoom
in you get more detail. For example, when
you zoom in to Landranger format
you see individual field boundaries (stone walls, fences,
or hedgerows shown as thin black lines) 
which can be extremely useful when you are 
following a path through a farming area. It's
useful to see if you are on the wrong side of
a field boundary because otherwise you may find
yourself headed into a dead end with no outlet.
  
The OS Maps app is designed to work with your account on the OS web
site. You can use the web version of the map on a large
screen computer to draw a route. That route is 
automatically available on an iPhone or Android that
is signed into the same Ordnance Survey account.

#### Don't Forget to Download!

You need to remember that using a map on your phone 
(such as the OS Maps app or AllTrails) works differently
depending on whether you are connected to the internet.
When connected you can move around the map freely to
look at different areas. But in the center of Dartmoor
or some other isolated spot, you can't rely on a cell
signal to connect you to the internet. Before you
venture out on a walk without internet access, 
you need to display the area
on the screen where you expect to walk and then use
the menu to explicitly download that map to your phone.
As a test, switch to airplane mode to disconnect from
the internet to verify that you can still see the map
for the area you need once you are out of cell phone coverage.

#### Open Street Maps

Open Street Maps (OSM) is similar to Wikipedia, except for maps.
Anyone can contribute. A community of volunteer mappers
maintains information of roads, trails, and tons of geographic
detail all over the world. Coverage of information about 
paths and roads in the UK is generally quite good. 

For an overview of walking routes in the UK (and elsewhere)
see the site [Waymarked Trails](https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/#?map=12!54.5331!-3.4289).
The link here shows the western start of the Coast to Coast Path.

### An Illustrative Comparison of Different Tools

To show how various mapping tools compare, let's focus on an
area near the western start of the Coast to Coast Path (C2C).
For a long distance walk such as the C2C, you're likely
to have a guide book which will include some sort of map as
well as some detailed route notes.

#### Guide Books

[Trailblazer](https://trailblazer-guides.com/book/coast-to-coast-path) 
offers a series of popular guide books, including one for the 
Coast to Coast. 

{{< insert_photo src="img/c2c trailblazer sample.jpg"
  alt="Trailblazer Sample"  right="yes" width=500
  caption="Typical Route Map in a Trailblazer Guide" >}}
  
The Trailblazer maps combine route notes with a simple, chatty map.
While not as detailed as an Ordnance Survey map, it
has enough information to get you where you need to go.
I've used them for the several trips.
They are effective.

The Trailblazer map is very focused on the standard route.
If you stray off that route, either by mistake or because of a side-trip,
you will not know where you are. The same applies to
route notes in general. That's why you should also have
a general map (either paper or electronic). 

Trailblazer offers free delivery world wide. 
If you buy one online from place such as Amazon,
make sure you have the latest edition. And remember to [check their web site
for updates](https://trailblazer-guides.com/updates).

[Cicerone](https://www.cicerone.co.uk/books?region=357)
is another publisher of popular guide books. While Trailblazer
tends to focus on the more well-known long distance routes,
Cicerone has a much wider selection of books, many of which
focus on a particular county or area of England. Searching their
catalog is fun because it covers areas that we as Americans
probably have never heard of. For example, try
[Walking in the Forest of Bowland and Pendle](https://www.cicerone.co.uk/walking-in-the-forest-of-bowland-and-pendle)

> A guidebook to 40 diverse circular day walks suitable for walkers with navigational skills. The Forest of Bowland and Pendle are two of north west England's upland AONBs, perfect for walkers who enjoy exploring rough hilly, sometimes pathless terrain. The routes include Ward's Stone, Pendle Hill, Longridge Fell and Fair Snape Fell.

Sounds interesting! Like most Americans, I had never heard of 
the Forest of Bowland or Pendle. **AONB** stands for [Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty).
Compared with national parks, AONBs are a next level form of 
conservation for some rural areas, 

I've used a couple of Cicerone guides (or the Cleveland Way and the Two Moor's Way).
They have detailed route notes accompanied by excerpts from Ordnance Survey maps.
In some cases they include map booklet which contains a more complete map of the area.
As with the Trailblazer guides, they also have notes on flora and fauna, services,
and points of interest.

### Navigation the Old-Fashioned Way: Compass and Paper Map

The Ordnance Survey web site has an 
[introduction to compass and maps](https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/guides/beginners-guides-map-reading/). 
There's an [advanced](https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/guides/map-reading-skills-advanced-guides/) page as well.
There are many other resources on the web, 
but one advantage of the OS site is it is oriented toward the
specifics of the UK, Ordnance Survey maps, and the UK grid 
system used by OS maps and other map suppliers in the UK. 

I [basic compass](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/compass.html) 
is a good thing to have, just in case. It doesn't need
to be very expensive or very complicated.

### Using Your Phone as a Compass

Most smart phones can also serve as a compass. 
The iPhone comes with the [Compass app](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/compass-iph1ac0b663/ios).

There also is a free app from the Ordnance Survey called 
OS Locate (for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/os-locate/id810024913)
or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ordnancesurvey.oslocate.android&hl=en_US&gl=US)).
OS Locate will show your location in terms of standard
UK grid coordinates and can serve as a base plate compass.

### Just in Case

#### Have a Backup

OS Maps and AllTrails and other GPS resources are great,
but always have a backup. Don't get into trouble because
you lose your phone or run out of battery. You should have
a compass and some sort of map as backup. If you plan
to rely heavily on your phone, you may need an
extra external battery. If you're doing a multi-day
walk and staying in B&B's, make sure you have a routine
to get your phone charged and to make sure you don't
accidentally leave your charger behind.

#### Where Am I and How To Communicate That To Someone Else

In case of emergency, you may need to tell someone
where you are. 
If you have a smart phone or a satnav device, GPS can tell
you where you are. You can specify a location in terms
of longitude and latitude. For example, in Google maps,
press and hold a spot on the map until you see "dropped pin"
at the bottom of the screen. Tap on the pin and you'll see a 
numerical value for latitude and longitude. That's where you 
are. 

But there may  be a catch. It turns out the earth
is not a perfect sphere and as a result there are multiple systems for
mapping latitude and longitude to its imperfect shape.
Google Maps and GPS use a coordinate system called [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System).
The catch is the UK Ordnance Survey maps uses a UK-centric system
[OSGB36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid).
In case you want to nerd out on why there's more than one way
to map latitude and longitude to the earth's surface,
check this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum).

GPS and Google Maps and other world-wide maps use WGS84. The UK uses OSGB36
(or something similar). The practical issue is that the same latitude
and longitude coordinates expressed in WGS84 can be about 500 meters away
from the same coordinates expressed in OSGB36. 

The upshot is that if you report your location to emergency service
via latitude and longitude from Google maps, they might
interpret that as being from the UK system.  

I first encountered this issue when I
downloaded way points from a guide
book that uses the UK system (OSGB36) and imported them
into Open Street Maps on my Garmin GPS which uses WGS84.
I quickly saw that something was off. One might
be looking for a bridge or a trail intersection that might
be 500 or so meters off from what you expected. It's something
to keep in mind. If you have a handheld satnav (such as from 
Garmin) there usually is a setting that let's you choose
what coordinate system you want to use.

#### OS Locate

In the UK people often communicate location in terms of the
grid reference system that is specific to the UK rather than using
latitude and longitude There's an app called [OS Locate](https://shop.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/apps/os-locate/) 
for iPhone and Android that will report your location in 
UK grid reference terms or in latitude and longitude
based on OSGB36. It also can be used as a compass.
It's a good thing t have on your phone, just in case.

#### The UK Grid System

Ordnance Survey maps (and therefore many other maps for the UK)
emphasize identification of locations in terms of the [national
grid system](https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/guides/beginners-guide-to-grid-references/). 
There's a section on each OS paper map that describes
the grid system. A grid reference consists of two letters which
describe the general area followed by 4 or 6 numeric digits
(more digits, more precision). 

For example, the grid reference for the start of the South West Coast Path
in Minehead is SS971467. Expressed as latitude and longitude, that's
51°12′37″N , 003°28′24″W (degrees, minutes, seconds) 
or 51.210351 , -3.4733859 (degrees). The UK grid reference
is totally unfamiliar to an American audience but 
is widely used in the UK.

### More Map Resources

If you are looking for a tutorial
in the details of taking advantage of map and
compass there is a series of posts by Glyn Dodwell [map reading & navigation](https://onthehills.uk/2019/01/28/map-reading-navigation-part-1/)

## Ways You Can Go Wrong and How to Avoid Them

My most embarrassing navigation mistake happened on the Pennine Way.
It was raining so I was a bit buttoned up. I walked down the
path to a spot where it crossed a busy road. I stopped there for a
bit of a break and had a small snack and a drink. 
During my break, I somehow got
it into my head that I had crossed the road and just started up
the path. But I hadn't crossed the road so when I headed up the
path I was actually heading back in the direction I had come from.
I probably went almost a quarter of a mile before I checked my
GPS track and realized I was retracing my steps. 
Nagging doubt is your friend! Listen to it.
When in doubt, check! 

Some of my difficult navigation experiences have
occurred while I was following a local route suggested
by a pamphlet from the local TIC (tourist information center).
The local route may not be that heavily used and may
or may not have signs when you need. A crude hand
drawn map that may go along with a pamphlet like that
is not enough to keep you from getting lost. 
You need a good map or a good mapping app on your phone.

There are a number of situations that have tended to
increase my chances of error. You may encounter a 
pasture area where the problem is that there are
a bewildering multiple of paths you might follow,
paths made by grazing sheep or cattle. That's 
a time when you need to keep an eye on your GPS or
your compass. Another situation that has caused
me problems is when I'm striding along a nice
wide track and my intended route turns off onto 
a small, less visible path at the side. 
Unless you are paying
attention, it may be easy to miss the turn.
As I said at the beginning of this section,
don't be over-confident. If you have any
doubts, check where you are.

### A GPS Trace to Keep on Track

{{< figure src="img/os_maps_sample-1.png#floatleft"  
  caption="<font size=2>OS Maps sample</font>" >}}
{{< figure src="img/sample_off_route1.png"  
  caption="<font size=2>GPS off-route Open Street Map</font>" >}}
  
One nice feature of using a SatNav (GPS) device or a smart phone
is that you may be able to quickly look at the device to see
whether you have wandered off route.

I enjoy saving GPS traces as a 
[souvenir of my walks](https://goldin.shinyapps.io/Walks/).
When I zoom into the detail I can sometimes see places
here I went wrong.

## Ordnance Survey Trig Points

{{< insert_photo src="img/On Roseberry Topping.jpeg"
  alt="Trig Point"  right="yes"
  caption="Trig Point on Roseberry Topping" >}}

The Ordnance Survey is not just maps. It actually
has a visible presence on the ground.
On many high points one finds a concrete pillar that
marks one of the known
[survey points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retriangulation_of_Great_Britain)
that anchor the maps created by the Ordnance Survey.
Because the trig pillars are located at a high spot with
a good view, one generally feels a sense of accomplishment
having reached one.

Between 1935 and 1962 more than 6,500 concrete pillars
marked the basis for the UK Ordnance Survey grid.
Traditional survey techniques required that in
clear weather it be possible to see at least two
other trig points from any one trig point. 
(Or so they say. I can't say that I've been
able to verify that.)
