  This site is aimed mostly at myself. I enjoy working on projects. The act of publishing
  something to this web site helps to focus my efforts.
  It is satisfying and motivating to see an actual product appear on this site.
  That makes playing around with a project more fun.
  
  From time to time I also may produce something that is of interest to an outside
  audience. Many times I have learned something useful after a web search has landed me on some
  stranger's writing on the web. I hope this site may prove useful to others who stumble across it.
  
  ### About Me
  
  I am semi-retired. Until 2011 I was the Director of Institutional Research at 
  Yale University. The "semi" part is that I still have a small involvement
  with my old office.
  
  #### Me and Computers
  
  I've enjoyed computers and computing ever since my first
  computer course at Michigan State during my sophomore year.
  I used to keep lists of programming languages in which I had
  done some work: FORTRAN, APL, COBOL, PL/I, 
  Basic, Pascal, Forth, Java, C, C++, plus lots of languages related to
  data systems such as 4D, SAS, Focus, BrioQuery, and many others.
  I started using R in 2006 and it satisfied my itch
  for a programming language that provided an
  interactive connection with the data and the power of 
  visualizations. 
  
  I enjoy having a project to work on that combines some R coding and some
  simple data analysis. For the last year that has been Connecticut Covid stats
  or digging deep into the millions of rows of data exported from my iPhone and
  Apple Watch. I'm glad the internet was invented before I retired.

  Thank you to Alison Presmanes Hill and RStudio for creating the [Hugo Ap√©ro theme](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app) which has nudged me to attempt a more expressive and attractive site.
