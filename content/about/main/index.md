  This site is aimed mostly at myself. I enjoy working on projects. The act of publishing
  something to this web site helps to focus my efforts.
  It is satisfying and motivating to see an actual product appear on this site.
  That makes playing around with a project more fun.
  
  From time to time I also may produce something that is of interest to an outside
  audience. Many times I have learned something useful after a web search has landed me on some
  stranger's writing on the web. I hope this site may prove useful to others who stumble across it.

  Thank you to Alison Presmanes Hill and RStudio for creating the [Hugo Ap√©ro theme](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app) which has nudged me to attempt a more expressive and attractive site.
