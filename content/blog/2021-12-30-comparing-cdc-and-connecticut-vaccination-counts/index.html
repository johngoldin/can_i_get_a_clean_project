<p>This post will compare COVID vaccination rates reported by Connecticut
Department of Public Health with the reports from the CDC. We’ll display
the comparison two ways, first with a table and then with a bar chart.
Until recently “fully vaccinated” referred to individuals with two doses
of Pfizer or Moderna or one dose of J&amp;J. In this post we’ll refer to
those people as “two does” even if they have had only one dose of J&amp;J.</p>

<p>Below is a visual summary of the same vaccination counts by source. The
brown bars show vaccinations reported by CDC and the green bars show
Connecticut Department of Health. The figure includes a data point to
show the total population of each county according to the 2020 Census.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/county_plot2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This post will compare vaccination counts (and vaccination rates)
published by the CDC and by the Connecticut Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>First, let’s look at a summary of county-by-county COVID vaccinations in
Connecticut reported by CDC and by CT DPH. After that we will dig into
why these counts are different.</p>
<p>For Connecticut, the CDC reports about 8% more individuals who are fully
vaccinated than does DPH. Looking at partially vaccinated (one dose of
Moderna or Pfizer), CDC reports 46% more individuals. Counting things
can be hard. The details of what is included and how the counts are done
makes a difference.</p>
<p>This pattern has been observed in other states. There are a number of
attempts to go into the details of CDC versus state counts for
particular states. See this <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2021/12/county-level-cdc-and-dhs-vaccination-statistics-for-wisconsin-vary-in-important-ways/">recent analysis of county level counts in
Wisconsin</a>.
See also comments by Washington State on <a href="https://www.coronavirus.wa.gov/news/vaccine-data-reconciliation-between-state-and-federal-sources-will-take-time">differences between their
counts and
CDC</a>.</p>
<p>There seem to be two big issues.</p>
<p>The major reason that the CT DPH count are lower is that they do not
include vaccinations by “federal sources” such as the VA or DOD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…does not included doses administered to CT residents by
out-of-state providers or by some Federal entities (including
Department of Defense, Department of Correction, Department of
Veteran’s Affairs, Indian Health Service) because they are not yet
reported to CT WiZ (the CT immunization Information System)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>States may vary as to whether they include data from federal providers
and whether they have information about vaccination of residents that
were administered in other states. In neighboring Massachusetts, their
<a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/daily-covid-19-vaccine-report-january-21-2022/download">vaccination
report</a>
states that their numbers only included vaccinations reported from the
Veterans Administration for MA residents as of 11/4/2021. State
immunization information systems may not have information from all
providers in the state.</p>
<p>How comprehensive is the information for Connecticut? I don’t really
know. I received my first two doses from a clinic operated by Yale New
Haven Hospital. My booster dose came from Walgreens. When I looked up my
vaccination record in CT WiZ I was pleased to see that all three doses
were recorded (as were my flu shots for 2020 and 2021). I receive my
primary care through a system that uses the Yale New Haven Hospital
electronic health record, but in that system my third dose of COVID
vaccination is <em>not</em> recorded. (I’ll need to communicate that to them
separately.)</p>
<p>Another problem for the state totals is the possibility of vaccination
done out of state. This may be an issue for college students and
“snowbird” retirees who spend part of the year in different states.
Also, the state of residence listed at the time of a vaccination for
such individuals may not be the same place the individual is counted in
the 2020 census. Uncertainty about residence is an issue for both the
numerator and denominator of reported vaccination rates by locality.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/cdc-senior-covid-vaccination-rates-appear-inflated/">Kaiser Health
News</a>
article suggested that CDC vaccination rates may be too high.</p>
<p>There have been significant issues surrounding data quality throughout
the COVID pandemic. In 2020 the <a href="https://covidtracking.com">COVID Tracking
Project</a> emerged from multiple efforts to try
to obtain comparable statistics about the path of the epidemic in the
United States. It was a volunteer effort and suspended operation in
March 2021 at a point when they felt the data could be obtained from
<span class="math display">\[federal
sources\]</span>(<a href="https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/federal-covid-data-101-how-to-find-data" class="uri">https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/federal-covid-data-101-how-to-find-data</a>.</p>
<p>First I’ll do a direct comparison of county by county vaccination data
for Connecticut reported by the CDC and the tallies from the Connecticut
<a href="https://data.ct.gov/stories/s/CoVP-COVID-Vaccine-Distribution-Data/bhcd-4mnv/">Department of Public
Health</a>.
Then I will dig into the known differences between these reports. Both
the CDC and CT DPH have made a real effort to be transparent about their
reports. There’s quite a bit of information available on the Web
describing how they are tabulating vaccinations.</p>

<h3>How the CDC Tracks Vaccinations</h3>

<p>In 2020 before vaccines were ready for distribution, plans were made
about tracking the COVID vaccines.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Counting “Fully” Vaccinated</h3>
<p>The CDC gives a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/reporting-vaccinations.html">full
discussion</a>
reasons why it may be hard for them to track different doses of COVID
vaccines at the national level. That’s especially true for boosters
because there is a long internval after the second dose and a booster is
more likely to have been given by a different provider or in a different
location. The de-identified data that CDC receives does not include the
identifer that may be in use at the state level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To protect the privacy of vaccine recipients, CDC receives data
without any personally identifiable information (de-identified data)
about vaccine doses. Each jurisdiction or provider uses a unique
person identifier to link records within their own systems. However,
CDC cannot use the unique person identifier to identify individual
people by name.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are challenges in linking doses when someone is vaccinated in
different jurisdictions or from different providers. Even with the
high-quality data CDC receives from jurisdictions and federal
entities, there are limits to how CDC can analyze those data. If a
person received doses in more than one jurisdiction or from different
providers within the same jurisdiction, they could receive different
unique person identifiers for different doses. CDC may not be able to
link multiple unique person identifiers for different jurisdictions or
providers to a single person.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, most people receive their first and second dose of a
2-dose vaccine from the same provider because those doses are given
within just a few weeks of each other. As they receive their booster
dose months later, it’s possible they will go to a new location for
that dose. The person may have moved or the provider who gave them
their initial doses may no longer offer vaccination. This often
happens for people who went to mass vaccination clinics that have
since closed. In such a scenario, the person’s booster dose may appear
to be their first dose when reported. This is just one example of how
CDC’s data may over-estimate first doses and under-estimate booster
doses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CDC provides an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/overview/IT-systems.html">overview of IT systems for tracking COVID
vaccinations</a>.
The information architecture depends on 64 Immunization Information
Systems (IIS), which are mostly state based. The system was develop
before COVID and was primarily aimed at childhood immunizations, but
always covered other immunizations as well. That’s why I can see my many
of my non-COVID vaccinations in my Connecticut IIS (CT WiZ).</p>
<p>They describe a lot of detail about the legal process.</p>
<p>It looks like there are supposed to be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/iz-gateway/gateway-qa.html">explicit
provision</a>
for how data goes from federal providers (such as DOD) to the state (via
its IIS).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Connect component of the IZ Gateway, will participating IISs
receive data (push) from VAMS and other non-traditional vaccination
providers (e.g., DoD) who administered vaccinations within the IIS’s
jurisdiction?</p>
<p>Yes, in the Connect component of IZ Gateway, participating IISs will
receive data from VAMS for patients in their jurisdictions.
Participating IISs will also receive data for patients in their
jurisdictions from non-traditional vaccination providers that are
onboarded to IZ Gateway Connect and not already connected to IISs.</p>
<p>How does provider-initiated multijurisdictional data exchange work?</p>
<p>The Provider-Initiated Multijurisdictional Data Exchange component of
IZ Gateway allows providers to initiate a query for immunization
information from multiple jurisdictions.</p>

<h2>On the General Issue of the Role of Data in Responding to the Pandemic</h2>
<p>In January 2022 Bob Wachter did an interview with Eric Topol that
reviewed the state of pandemic at that moment. Near the end of the
interview, there’s an interesting section where BW asks about why the US
seems to need to rely on data from other countries. Here is a transcript
of that portion of the interview (which starts at 48:03 on the YouTube
video):</p>
<p>The Omicron Whirlwind: A Conversation with Eric Topol about the Current
and Future State of the Pandemic January 13, 2022 Bob Wachter
interviewing Eric Topol Bob Watchter is Chair, UCSF Department of
Medicine. Eric Topol is a cardiologist and founder and director of the
Scripps Research Institute</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BW: That’s a good pivot to something you were beginning to talk about
but I sort of moved it along, but let’s get back to it. Up until two
years ago, you’d see a paper in a journal and it was from UK or from
Israel or from South Africa, you’d say, ‘Oh, that’s not America. I’m
waiting for the study.’ Whereas for the last two years, it seems like
almost all of the insights, or many of them, come from studies from
other countries. They have better data systems, they are investing
more in clinical research. What’s going on and what do we need to do
to be leaders in this area? Because it really feels like we’re
followers.</p>
<p>ET: We are followers. And we have pathetic data systems. I mean,
pathetic. And the one thing that really strikes me, Bob, is that we of
course support the current administration and the fact that the mantra
sticking to the science. But there has been all these announcements
from day one of taking on administration through today, there has not
been one mention of improving our data system. Not a mention. And this
is just preposterous. Yes, we are forced to rely on other country’s
data, but when these advisory committees for FDA and CDC convene, they
basically are unwilling to accept that data even though there’s not
data here in this country, because, like for example, right now we
want to know whether these Omicron boosters, how well they’re working
to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. And when do they wane? When
does their protection <span class="math display">\[wane?\]</span>. Those people who are getting
hospitalized who had a third shot, what’s going on there? We were
promised by the CDC in May that they would track every breakthrough
hospitalization and death. Never happened. And so we don’t have
critical data. We have 150,000-plus people in the hospital. And I have
begged at the HHS level that we have granular data on each of those
people. Their vaccination status, which vaccine, when they got it,
their age, their co-existing conditions, and all the basal stuff,
right? And they say, “Well, we’re gonna look into it.” Even though it
can be mandated by HHS authority. So we have just a dreadful situation
here where we don’t have real-time capture of data. The only data that
gets posted on the CDC is a month old, and it’s de minimus about
things like hospitalizations or deaths, and this is unacceptable. If
you’re gonna go in a pandemic and try to deliver and guidance, you
have to have data. That’s how you develop trust. That’s how you have
the best navigation system. And we don’t have it. But the most
important thing to me, Bob, is there’s no seeming will to get one. And
that is distressing and it has to change.</p>
<p>BW: Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>ET: Well, the main thing to me is that we have a Secretary of HHS, who
came from California, the attorney general, he hasn’t shown up for the
pandemic. Have you seen him? Have you seen him make a statement?</p>
<p>BW: I saw him talking about how the CDC director doesn’t have a degree
in marketing the other day. That was interesting.</p>
<p>ET: I see, I see, Yeah we have a serious problem. HHS, there’s been a
lot of infighting between the agencies. And the HHS secretary should
be bringing that together. And so we have a serious problem is we have
a no-show HHS secretary. We have an HHS that could mandate this data
capture, but they’re afraid, in my view, of political backlash. That’s
why they’re not doing it. And you just can’t. Yeah, we’re a big
country, but yo know what, a big country without data is in a horrible
situation. So we have to rely on other countries. And fortunately we
have amazing data that comes out of places like the UK and Israel and
Denmark and South Africa. So many that has been terrific for us. But
it’s amazing we have a different population here, we’re much less
vaccinated, much less boosted, we have lots of co-existing conditions
that are not as prevalent in some of these other countries, and yet we
don’t have data. I don’t know. I mean, I just don’t think that the
administration has delivered to sticking to the science because part
of the science is having the data.</p>
<p>BW: Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>Would better data tracking have made a difference in fighting the
pandemic in the US? Possibly not. But individuals and local governments
have been struggling to figure out best practices while the facts are
uncertain and knowledge is still being developed.</p>
