### Post content

Typical location to start editing 


```{r libraries, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

path_saved_export <- "~/Dropbox/Programming/R_Stuff/john_vitals/Apple-Health-Data/"
path_to_healthexport1 <- "~/Documents/R_local_repos/applehealth1/R/"

a <- 1 + 2
b <- "Text in quoted string"
# commented text

```

What does R text look like?
