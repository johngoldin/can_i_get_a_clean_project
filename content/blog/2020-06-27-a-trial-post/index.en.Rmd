If you prefer not to use the `fig.width` and `fig.height` options in every plot chunk, edit the YAML (the part at the top of the post) with:

{{< columns >}}

This is column 1.

{{< column >}}

This is column 2.

{{< endcolumn >}}

now we are proceeding after the multicolumn section with a fairly long line to test what happens.
