This post is Part II of a dive into the contents of the Apple Health Export.
[Part I](/blog/apple-health-export-1/) covered how to export the data from the Health app and import it into
R tables. It also described in detail how to adjust time stamps for daylight
savings and travel out of the local time zone.

Based on Part I, I assume you have your data in the data frame `health_df`. 
The Health app emphasizes daily summaries of your data such as resting heart
rate, total steps, and the items the are covered by the "rings" that you see
in the Activity app. We will look at some summary in Part III, but in this
post the emphasisis will be on the detail that are recorded in the Apple
Health Kit almost moment by moment. In part I I marvelled at how I had over
four million rows of data in `health_df`. What is all that stuff and what
is it good for.

I am going to restrict this post to the data that is generated by Watch OS
5.1.1.  Before OS 5 data was recorded much less frequently. When I first 
looked at the OS 5 data I noticed a few anomalies in the earliest versions.
Things seemed to settle down by 5.1.1 which in my case started in November 2018.
