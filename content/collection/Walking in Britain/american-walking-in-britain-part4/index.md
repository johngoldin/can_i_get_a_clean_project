## There are Lots of Aids to Navigation

For the official long-distance routes on the coast, navigation is mostly
easy. Just keep the ocean to your left 
(or right, depending on your general heading).
And yet on the first day of setting out from Padstow on
the South West Coast Path I managed to follow
a finger post that said "SWCP" that pointed in
the direction opposite from my intended direction.
It's hard to explain how I did that. I won't bore you
with a long paragraph on how I turned myself around.
The point is that it's possible to get off track.

My most important piece of advice is don't be over confident
and assume you know where you are. When in doubt, check.
You're on foot so if you start going in an incorrect direction it
can take you a long time to fix your mistake. Better to notice
quickly that you are off your intended route and do something
about it sooner rather than later.

### Maps

The Ordnance Survey is the government organization that does 
maps for the UK. It's comparable the US Geological Survey in
the US, except it's products are much more pervasive and relied on.
OS paper maps are widely available in bookstores and local shops.
The OS Explorer series is aimed at walkers. The scale is 
very tight: 4cm on the map is equal to 1km in the real world 
(a scale of 1:25000). 

A paper map at that scale turns out
to be fairly bulky and unweildy. I confess I have almost never
used the 1:25K scale OS maps. 
Instead on multi-day walks I have relied on Harvey Maps, 
whose slogan is "a good week's walking on one map".
Harvey maps are availble for the national trails and
other popular longer routes. The scale is 1:40K rather
than 1:25K. There's enough detail to find your way,
but it's easier to get the map unfolded so that you 
can see the spot you need. They are printed on
waterproof paper, a good feature for a map you plan
to need for a week.

There is also the OS Landranger series. At a 
scale of 1:50K you can see a much larger area for a given
size of paper. It's not as detailed as the 
Explorer maps, but it's generally good enough to help
you find your way. If you are spending a lot of time
in a location not covered by a Harvey map,
the Explorer maps are a good alternative.

#### Maps on Your Phone

The Ordnance Survey offers maps on Android or iPhone
via their OS Maps app. My most recent holiday in the UK
was in 2019 so I used other electronic aids,
primarily AllTrails on my iPhone and a Garmin
GPS (SatNav in Britspeak) loaded with Open Street Map.
For my next trip I expect to rely on OS Maps.
Access is by subscription, but you can get a 
one-month premium access for £3.99, which is a good deal.
By comparison, a single Landranger paper maps costs £8.99.

My most embarrassing navigation mistake happened on the Pennine Way.
It was raining so I was a bit buttoned up. I walked down the
path to a spot where it crossed a busy road. I stopped there for a
bit of a break and had a small snack and a drink. 
During my break, I somehow got
it into my head that I had crossed the road and just started up
the path. But I hadn't crossed the road so when I headed up the
path I was actually heading back in the direction I had come from.
I probably went almost a quarter of a mile before I checked my
GPS track and realized I was retracing my steps. 
Nagging doubt is your friend! Listen to it.
When in doubt, check!

Some of my difficult navigation experiences have
occurred while I was following a local route suggested
by a pamphlet from the local TIC (tourist informaiton center).
The local route may not be that heavily used and may
or may not have signs when you need. The crude hand
drawn map that may go along with a pamphlet like that
is not enough to keep you from getting lost. 
You need a good map or a good mapping app on your phone.

### Ordnance Survey Trig Points

On many high points one finds a concrete pillar that
marks one of the known points that make up the
[survey points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retriangulation_of_Great_Britain)
that anchor the maps created by the Ordance Survey.
Because the trip pillars are located at a high spot with
a good view, one generally feels a sense of accompishment
having reached one.


The [original version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_Triangulation_of_Great_Britain) 
was done between 1791 and 1853.
