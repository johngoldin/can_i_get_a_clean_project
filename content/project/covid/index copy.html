<p>There is a new <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Data-Tracker">data tracker
map</a> that
displays the rate of cases in the last two weeks by town. It is
color-coded to indicate where cases are most prevalent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.johngoldin.com/2020/03/covid-19-cases-in-connecticut/">My post on Covid-19 back in
March</a>
tracked the growth of the epidemic as it hit Connecticut. Back at the
end of March I did not realize that the greater New York area (including
Connecticut) would be the center of the first wave in the US. At that
time what I was reading focused on the nature of exponential growth of
an epidemic. We were urged to âflatten the curveâ and that shaped the
way I presented the data in that post. I have been updating the figures
in that post each evening. During that time the <a href="https://data.ct.gov/stories/s/COVID-19-data/wa3g-tfvc/">Connecticut data
portal</a> has
expanded considerably, and Iâve built <a href="https://github.com/johngoldin/ctcorona/blob/master/R/daily_ct_stats.R">some R
code</a>
that letâs me easily update that post. Iâll use the same data
infrastructure for this post as well. This post is more oriented toward
tracking the current status of the epidemic in Connecticut.</p>

<h2>Tracking the Virus in Connecticut</h2>
<p>This post focuses on what is happening currently. The aim is to use the
recent trend to get some idea of the near future. The first plot will
show the average number of new cases reported each day along with a line
that displays the rolling seven-day average. Typically there are
day-of-the-week effects in the reporting so itâs best to focus on the
seven-day average.</p>

<p><br/> The number of new cases peaked in mid April and then began to
decrease rapidly, although not as rapidly as it increased. A key issue
is how fast epidemic is expanding or contracting. One indicator of that
is to estimate the parameter R<sub>t</sub>, the average number of people
who become infected by an infectious person. When R<sub>t</sub> is
greater than 1 the number of daily new cases is increasing, If
R<sub>t</sub> is less than 1, it is decreasing. See the site
<a href="https://covidestim.org">covidestim Â· COVID-19 nowcasting</a> for an estimate by state of the effective
value for R<sub>t</sub>. The site is described in <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/21/21227855/coronavirus-spreading-by-state-instagram-effective-reproduction-rate">this
article</a>
at Vox.com. I donât claim to have the expertise to evaluate the quality
of the calculation of R at the <a href="https://covidestim.org">covidestim</a> site, but it
seems to jive with other information about the pattern of the epidemic
among states.</p>
<p>As of June (and a month previous), Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey
have among the lowest values for R<sub>t</sub> in the country. This is
good news for us in Connecticut. I have included R<sub>t</sub> for
Arizona as well as Connecticut to provide a contrast with a state that
has lately shown <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-medical-experts-alarmed-over-surge-in-covid-19-cases">signs of a growing
outbreak</a>.
The goal in Connecticut and in the entire New York City area is to keep
R<sub>t</sub> well under 1. As of
04/28/2021 R<sub>t</sub> is
0.79.
On the other hand, in Arizona R<sub>t</sub> is about
0.86.</p>

<p>The next display shows the trend of R<sub>t</sub> in each state arranged

is a measure of the rate of increase. When R<sub>t</sub> is greater than
1 the number of daily new cases is increasing, If R<sub>t</sub> is less
than 1, it is decreasing. The color of the R line shows whether the most
recent estimate of R for a state is <span style="color: #af8dc3">above 1 (purple

<p><br/> The tallest graphs of new cases per 100K of population are New
York and Arizona.. From the point of view of someone living in
Connecticut, the striking thing is how thoroughly Connecticut (and New
York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts) have recovered from
the peak. New cases are low and the low value of the estimate of R
confirms that they are likely to decrease even more. The great contrast
is with the increase of cases in some of the southern states.

<p>Deaths increase with age, as has been well known since the beginning of
the epidemic. For cases, the number of cases per population stays
relatively flat from 20 to 79 and rises very rapidly for the oldest
category. I havenât examined this data closely, but I assume this
pattern is related to the high rates of mortality in nursing homes. For
the age range from 60 to 79 there probably are a lot of seniors who are
going to a great deal of trouble avoiding places and situations where
there is risk of catching the virus. But individuals in nursing homes
donât have that much control over their own lives. I would guess that
the older population outside of nursing homes has a lower rate of
catching the virus and the population inside nursing homes has a higher
rate. The two trends may average out to a rate that is the same as
middle aged adults. This is just speculation. I havenât dug into the
data to say anything firm about this</p>
</div>
<div id="nursing-homes" class="section level2">
<h2>Nursing Homes</h2>
<p>Nursing homes have been hard hit by the epidemic. Itâs hard to control
coronavirus outbreak in a group living situation, which includes prisons
and cruises ship. On top of that, Covid-19 is especially serious for the
elderly. The combination in nursing homes has been deadly. There have
been 2,719 deaths in Connecticut
Nursing Homes which makes
33.6%
of the total of
8,084
deaths from Covid-19.</p>
</div>
<div id="prisons" class="section level2">
<h2>Prisons</h2>
<p>Prisons even more than nursing homes create a situation where it is hard
to limit exposure among individuals living together. We have less
information about prisons than about nursing homes. The Department of
Corrections (DOC) posts some statistics on <a href="https://data.ct.gov/Public-Safety/COVID-19-in-Correctional-Facilities/6t8i-du3u">total Covid19 rates among
prisoners and
staff</a>
via the state open data site and some limited information of <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DOC/Common-Elements/Common-Elements/Health-Information-and-Advisories">rates by
individual
facility</a>
on their web site, but the data are not as detailed or as accessible as
the data on nursing homes.</p>
<p>As of 04/29/2021,
4,463 inmates
have tested positive for Covid-19. At the peak of the epidemic,
158 inmates
were isolated at the Northern Correctional Institution medical facility.
The most recent report is that
19
died, and currently
NA
Covid-19 inmates remain in that medical facility.</p>
<p>Unlike nursing homes, the number of deaths from Covid-19 in prisons is
relatively low. Presumably that is because the prison population has
many fewer elderly people who are especially vulnerable to the effects
of Covid-19.</p>
<p>In addition to prisoners, the Department of Corrections reports that
1,643 staff
have tested positive for Covid-19, of whom
1,618 have been
cleared to return to work.</p>
<p>One cannot easily relate the number of cases reported by the Department
of Corrections to the town by town counts reported by the Department of
Public Health. Itâs clear that for small rural towns the prison cases
may swamp the community counts in those towns. For example, in the town
of Brooklyn in Windham County (population about 8,200) the DPH town
stats between June 17 and June 18 showed the number of cases jumped from
24 to 116. Thatâs the home of the Brooklyn Correctional Institution and
I have to believe that site dominated those numbers and that the process
by which the Department of Corrections reported test results to the
Department of Public Health affected the magnitude of the one-day jump.</p>
<p>In effect there is a separate epidemic occurring inside the prison
system and the pace of that epidemic does not necessarily correspond to
trends in the wider community. For the purposes of tracking Covid-19 in
the population of Connecticut generally, in some cases I will exclude
some of the small rural towns with prisons such as Somers, Montville,
and Brooklyn. But itâs not practical for me to segregate the effect of
prisons on counts for larger towns such as New Haven, Cheshire,
Hartford, and others. As of 6/16/2020, the DOC reported a cumulative
total of 117 cases among prisoners in Bridgeport, 125 in New Haven, 94
in Hartford, and 21 in Cheshire. Enfield is a tricky case. There are two
DOC facilities in Enfield and as of 6/16/2020 DOC reported 265 cases
there. Enfield has a population of about 44,000, but the prison cases
may have a significant effect on the picture of Covid-19 in Enfield.
Similar to Brooklyn, one can see likely effects in the reports. On
6/10/20 DPH reported a total of 447 Covid-19 cases in Enfield and the
next day on 6/11/2020 they reported 546, and increase of 22% in one day.
Thatâs highly likely to be an effect of how cases were reported from the
DOC facilities in Enfield and how those reports reached the Department
of Public Health.</p>

<h2>Variations by County in Connecticut</h2>
<p>Next Iâll look at variations within Connecticut. Below are two maps
showing the eight counties in Connecticut<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The first map in Figure
<a href="#fig:county-maps">9</a> shows the cumulative total of cases since the
start of the epidemic. The second map shows only new cases reporting
during the last two weeks. On both maps, cases are adjusted to show
cases per 100K of population. So the first map relates more to the total
impact of the disease over the full course of the epidemic to date, and
the second map is an indication of the recent prevalence of the virus.</p>
<p>Connecticut is part of the epidemicâs surge in the New York area and the
magnitude of the epidemic has been greater in the counties closer to New
York City. Back in March cases first appeared in Fairfield County and
then spread to Litchfield, New Haven, and Hartford. More recently
Hartford has been the area that we have to watch.</p>

<div id="by-county-and-type-of-town" class="section level3">
<h3>By County and Type of Town</h3>
<p>There are 169 towns in Connecticut, which makes it hard to examine
variations by town. To help examine variations within counties, Iâll use
a typology of towns called <a href="https://ctdatahaven.org/sites/ctdatahaven/files/UConnCPR%20Changing%20Demographics-5%20CTs%202004.pdf">The Five
Connecticuts</a>
that divides towns into five categories based on census variables: Urban
Core, Urban Periphery, Suburban, Rural, and a fifth category for Wealthy
Suburbs used for some towns in Fairfield County. Adjusting for
population, the number of cases has been greater in the counties closer
to New York City. In the figure below Iâll fold the wealthy towns into
the Suburban category. I have excluded Montville and Somers because the
prisons in those towns complicates interpretation of the town
statistics.</p>
<p>Counties are laid out from top to bottom and the counties closer to New
York are toward the top. The columns show the four categories. Urban
towns have been hit harder than suburban and rural towns. While density
may have some effect on case rates, the report <a href="https://ctdatahaven.org/reports/towards-health-equity-connecticut">Towards Health Equity in
Connecticut: The Role of Social Inequality and the Impact of
COVID-19</a>
by DataHaven documents how the epidemic interacts with existing social
inequality in Connecticut. <br/></p>

<h3>Details by Town</h3>
<p>The links below take you to a separate HTML page for each Connecticut
county. That page contains a table with one row for each town in the
county.</p>
<p>For each town it shows the category, the population, the total number of
cases to date, the number of recent cases per 100K of population (total
new cases in the last two weeks), total deaths, and the percentage of
total deaths in that town attributed to nursing home residents.</p>
<p>Next there are two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline">sparklines</a>
that show the trend in daily new cases and daily deaths (based on 14 day
moving average). Cases and deaths are shown as a ratio to population in
the town.</p>
<p>The purpose of these tables is to make it easier to quickly scan for
trends in local towns. Here is sample (based on my home of Guilford)
showing what is available for each town.</p>
<p>For each county there is also a map showing the towns in that county and
the relative number of total cases in the town and a second map that
shows the percentage of individuals who are below the poverty line.</p>
<p>The town sparklines at the right show the trends over time. The vertical
scale is different for new cases and for deaths. For new cases, the
maximum height shown on the scale is 100 while
for deaths, the maximum value shown is 23.7.
For both new cases and deaths, the sparkline shows the rolling seven day
average of new cases or deaths.</p>

<h2>Where Do Things Stand Today?</h2>
<p>As I write this on July 4, Connecticut seems to be in relatively good
shape. <a href="https://covidactnow.org/?s=61890">Covid ActNow</a> shows it as one
of only three states âon track to contain COVIDâ along with
Massachusetts and Vermont.<br />
It wonât be easy to sustain that situation. Some of our fellow
northeastern states have also done well but are struggling to maintain
their success.</p>
<p>I started burrowing into the Covid-19 data back in March in part because
Iâm a 70 year old male who therefore is at high risk (and because I love
to work in R and Iâm always looking for an excuse). The situation in
Connecticut looks and feels very different than it did in March-April.
One amazing feature of this epidemic is how differently it affects
subsets of the population. As a financially comfortable semi-retiree, it
was quite easy for me to hide from the virus by hiding from people in
general. Many, many people were not so fortunate. If you can get out of
the way of the virus, you do it. But if economic circumstances force you
to work face to face or if you are confined to a group living situation
or if where you live forces you to mingle with multiple generations and
multiple networks of interactions, it is much harder to avoid the virus.
Iâm equally shocked by how the economic effects hit individuals in
dramatically different ways. For someone in my circumstances there is
almost no effect. Meanwhile many people face economic ruin that will
affect them for the rest of their lives. The virus and its effects
cannot be contained by uncoordinated individual efforts. It takes
collective will and collective action. Many individuals are coping, but
collectively we are failing.</p>
<p>It is tragic watching the virus explode in the south and southwest. New
York and others showed that you can get it back under control, but it
took a maximum concerted effort. There is no sign that going to happen
in many parts of the country. <br/></p>

elsewhere is in the file
<a href="https://github.com/johngoldin/ctcorona/blob/master/R/daily_ct_stats.R">daily_ct_stats</a>.
This post was created using RMarkdown so the code to create most of the
figures is in the <a href="https://github.com/johngoldin/can_i_blog_too/blob/master/content/post/2020-06-22-tracking-covid-19-in-connecticut/index.en.Rmd">.Rmd file for this

<p>The separate HTML files for each Connecticut county were created using
the <a href="https://github.com/johngoldin/ctcorona/blob/master/R/render_town_summary_html.R">rmarkdown::render
function</a>.
The RMarkdown document that actually formatted the town details
(including sparklines and county maps) is

<div id="some-notes-on-the-data-available-from-the-department-of-public-health" class="section level3">
<h3>Some Notes on the Data Available From the Department of Public Health</h3>
<p>Sometimes there is a lag before cases and deaths end up in the daily
reports. As a result, there tends to be a âday of the weekâ effect. For
that reason, observers of the Covid-19 statistics generally focus on a
7-day rolling average of the daily counts. Some of the unusually large
peaks and valleys in these charts are due to reporting process. The DPH
has also begun producing reports based on the <a href="https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Number-of-COVID-19-Cases-by-Date-of-Specimen-Colle/xz44-6swc">date a sample was taken
for a
test</a>
and <a href="https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-associated-deaths-by-date-of-death/abag-bjkj">by the date of
death</a>.
Thatâs a more accurate way to look at the change over time, but it means
the data for the most recent days are hard to interpret because some
data may be âin processâ and not yet reported. In these charts I have
used âdate of reportâ rather than âdate of sample takenâ or âdate of
deathâ because that gives me all of the recent data that is available
and because that is what most other data projects (such as the COVID
Tracking Project or the New York Times) have been using.</p>
<p>The DPH reports always include a comment that âall data are preliminary
and subject to change.â But when they make and adjustment to correct
errors, as far as I can tell they do not go back and adjust the earlier
reports. That can lead to a misleading report of recent changes. For
example, in one note below they removed 70 cases because of errors on a
day in which there were 81 new cases. In the data series that I
download, that shows up as having been 11 new cases that day, not 81,
because 70 were removed. Earlier days are not corrected.</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary6012020.pdf?la=en">Note as of June
1</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>*In Connecticut during the early months of this pandemic, it became
increasingly clear that it would be necessary to track probable
COVID-19 cases and deaths, in addition to laboratory-confirmed (RT-
PCR) cases and deaths. This was needed to better measure the burden
and impact of this disease in our communities and is now part of the
national surveillance case definition for COVID-19. Today for the
first time, DPH is reporting cases and deaths as âconfirmedâ or
âprobable.â Previous reports reported these as a combined number. The
only change today is that they are being separated to conform with CDC
reporting guidance. Probable cases of COVID-19 involve persons who
have not had confirmatory laboratory testing (RT-PCR) performed for
COVID-19, but whose symptoms indicate they are very likely to have a
COVID-19 infection. In Connecticut, most of the probable COVID-19
cases involve persons whose death certificates list COVID-19 disease
or SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of death or a significant condition
contributing to death.</p>

<p><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary5272020.pdf?la=en">Note as of May
27</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The staff at the Department of Public Health have removed 356 cases
and 808 tests in the past 24 hours, which were identified as
duplicates in the system, affecting both test and overall case
numbers. Since yesterday, there have been 341 new positive cases, and
5,215 new tests were reported.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the data portal, the number of cases reported for Montville was 381
on June 17. As of June 18 it reports 293 cases, a reduction of 88 cases.
Thatâs more than the 70 cases removed. Perhaps the case counts for
Montville were affected by inmates being moved within the Connecticut
prison system.</p>

I donât see any explanation of this in the Department of Public Health

approximately 12,000 tests, 440 were positive. On Thursday, the state
