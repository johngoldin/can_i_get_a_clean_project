 ### About Me
  
  I am semi-retired. Until 2011 I was the Director of Institutional Research at 
  Yale University. The "semi" part is that I still have a small involvement
  with my old office.
  
  I grew up in a small town in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Rather than go
  to Penn State like my sisters, I went to Michigan State. In 1971 I came to 
  Yale as a graduate student in psychology. In 1976 I got a one-year
  temporary position as the director of research in the Undergraduate
  Admissions Office and with the Office of Institutional Research (OIR).
  I got a second one-year temporary job in OIR doing a study of alumni.
  After that I guess one could say I got a permanent position, because
  in some ways I'm still there.
  
  #### Me and Computers
  
  I've enjoyed computers and computing ever since my first
  computer course at Michigan State during my sophomore year.
  I used to keep lists of programming languages in which I had
  written at least one minimal program: FORTRAN, APL, COBOL, PL/I, 
  Pascal, Forth, Java, C, C++, plus lots of languages related to
  data systems such as 4D, SAS, Focus, BrioQuery, and many others.
  I started using R heavily in 1999 and the satisfied my itch
  for a programming language that suited me. I enjyed the
  interactive connection with the data and the power of 
  visualizations.
  
  I had a brief brush with R in the mid-1990's. I audited a data
  analysis course taught by John Hartigan which used S-Plus. 
  S-Plus wasn't available for Macs and I wanted to be able to do
  the assignments on my home Macs. A friend told me to try
  R. In late 1998 I was looking for some tools for doing
  visualizations. I relied on SAS for most of my work, but
  SAS was not an attractive choice for doing plots. I'm
  not sure how I heard about ggplot2. The "gg" was
  attractive. I was a teaching assistant for Lee Wilkinson
  back when I was a graduate student and I had actually
  checked out *The Grammar of Graphics* from the Yale
  Library. (I didn't actually read it and it didn't look
  like anybody else had either. It's an unusual book that has
  been read by few but proved to be extremely influential.)
  
  I started using ggplot2 quite a bit during 2008 (or possibly 2007).
