<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>CDC tends to report more COVID vaccinations than do state departments of
public health in part because vaccinations by federal entities (such as
DOD or the VA) are not included in the state reporting. On the other
hand, CDC seems to have problem distinguishing whether a particular
vaccination is a first dose or follow-up dose. For example, Connecticut
Department of Public Health reports a high percentage of shots are
booster doses than does the CDC. Attempts by the CDC to increase the
privacy of the vaccination records may undermine the quality of the
reporting while providing only a small increase in privacy.</p>
<p>This post will explore why CDC and CT Department of Public Health (CT
DPH) are reporting different COVID-19 vaccination counts for
Connecticut. The goal is to understand how the data makes its way into
the CDC and Connecticut summaries.</p>
<p>Below is a direct comparison of vaccination data for Connecticut
reported by the CDC and the tallies from the Connecticut <a href="https://data.ct.gov/stories/s/CoVP-COVID-Vaccine-Distribution-Data/bhcd-4mnv/">Department of
Public
Health</a>
county by county as of 10-May-2022. The column on the right shows how
many more vaccinations are reported by the CDC than by CT DPH. Note that
CDC reports 15%
more individuals with some vaccination, including
57%
more who have received only the initial dose.</p>

<p>“Fully vaccinated” has referred to individuals with two doses of Pfizer
or Moderna or one dose of J&amp;J. In this post we will refer to those
people as “two doses” even if they have had only one dose of J&amp;J.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-does-cdc-report-more-individuals-as-first-dose-only" class="section level2">
<h2>Why does CDC report more individuals as first dose only?</h2>
<p>State-wide and county by county the pattern is that CDC reports more
people vaccinated with at least one dose and more people who have
received only the first dose. This pattern has been observed in other
states. There are a number of attempts to go into the details of CDC
versus state counts for particular states. See this <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2021/12/county-level-cdc-and-dhs-vaccination-statistics-for-wisconsin-vary-in-important-ways/">analysis of county
level counts in
Wisconsin</a>
and also comments by Washington State on <a href="https://www.coronavirus.wa.gov/news/vaccine-data-reconciliation-between-state-and-federal-sources-will-take-time">differences between their
counts and
CDC</a>.</p>
<p>Early in December 2021, Kaiser Health News
<a href="https://khn.org/news/article/cdc-senior-covid-vaccination-rates-appear-inflated/">questioned</a>
why some senior vaccination rates seemed so high and also noted
increases in the number of individuals reporting only a first dose.</p>
<p>Later in December the CDC added a significant footnote to their vaccine
tracking page that gives a discussion of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/reporting-vaccinations.html">why it may be hard for them to
track different doses of COVID
vaccines</a>
at the national level. That’s especially true for boosters because there
is a long interval after the second dose and a booster is more likely to
have been given by a different provider or in a different location. The
de-identified data that CDC analysts work with does not include the
identifier that may be in use at the state level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To protect the privacy of vaccine recipients, CDC receives data
without any personally identifiable information (de-identified data)
about vaccine doses. Each jurisdiction or provider uses a unique
person identifier to link records within their own systems. However,
CDC cannot use the unique person identifier to identify individual
people by name.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are challenges in linking doses when someone is vaccinated in
different jurisdictions or from different providers. Even with the
high-quality data CDC receives from jurisdictions and federal
entities, there are limits to how CDC can analyze those data. If a
person received doses in more than one jurisdiction or from different
providers within the same jurisdiction, they could receive different
unique person identifiers for different doses. CDC may not be able to
link multiple unique person identifiers for different jurisdictions or
providers to a single person.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, most people receive their first and second dose of a
2-dose vaccine from the same provider because those doses are given
within just a few weeks of each other. As they receive their booster
dose months later, it’s possible they will go to a new location for
that dose. The person may have moved or the provider who gave them
their initial doses may no longer offer vaccination. This often
happens for people who went to mass vaccination clinics that have
since closed. In such a scenario, the person’s booster dose may appear
to be their first dose when reported. This is just one example of how
CDC’s data may over-estimate first doses and under-estimate booster
doses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December 2021 there were a number of articles that discussed issues
with the quality of the CDC vaccination tabulations (for example, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-cdcs-vaccine-data-is-all-wrong?s=w">Matt
Yglesias</a>
or <a href="https://khn.org/news/article/huge-gaps-in-vaccine-data-make-it-next-to-impossible-to-know-who-got-the-shots/">Kaiser Health
News</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="where-does-vaccination-data-come-from" class="section level2">
<h2>Where does vaccination data come from?</h2>
<p>To try to understand possible weakness in how CDC distinguishes among
first dose, second dose, and boosters, it’s necessary to examine the
details of how the data gets to the CDC. This will underscore some
limits in the reports at the state level as well.</p>
<p>Both the CDC and CT DPH have made a real effort to be transparent about
their reports. There’s quite a bit of information available on the Web
describing how they are tabulating vaccinations.</p>
<p>Connecticut DPH is reporting vaccination tabulations based on <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Immunizations/ALL-ABOUT-CT-WiZ">CT
WiZ</a>, the
Connecticut immunization information system. CDC gets data from CT DPH,
but they also get data from other state immunization information systems
which may include some Connecticut residents plus they also get
vaccinations done by federal entities that are not reported to CT WiZ.</p>
<p>There are several issues.</p>
<p>The major reason that the Connecticut DPH counts are lower overall than
CDC is that DPH does not have data on all vaccinations by “federal
sources” such as the VA or DOD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doses administered by some Federal entities (including Department of
Defense, Department of Correction, Department of Veteran’s Affairs,
Indian Health Service) are not yet reported to CT WiZ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How comprehensive is the information for Connecticut? All vaccine
providers who participate in the COVID-19 vaccination program <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/20201207-DPH-Order-regarding-reporting-COVID-19-vaccinations.pdf">are
required to report vaccinations to CT WiZ within 24
hours</a>.
For example, I received my first two doses from a clinic operated by
Yale New Haven Hospital. My booster dose came from Walgreens. When I
looked up my vaccination record in CT WiZ I was pleased to see that all
three doses were recorded (as were my flu shots for 2020 and 2021). I
receive my primary care through a system that uses the Yale New Haven
Hospital electronic health record, but in that system my third and
fourth doses of COVID vaccination are <em>not</em> recorded. (I’ll have to
communicated that to them separately.) When I got my second booster from
Walgreens, the record was available through CT WiZ within a couple of
days.</p>

<h2>The CDC Plan to Track Immunizations</h2>
<p>Internet searching of the CDC web site turns up a lot of information
about how CDC tracks COVID vaccinations, but almost all of it refers to
planning done during late 2020 in preparation for the roll out of
vaccines. CDC has a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/overview/IT-systems.html">web
page</a>
with an overview of the planned IT systems for tracking vaccinations and
an elaborate chart that describe the plan for data flows.</p>
<p><em>Keep in mind that this chart and other planning documents represent a
goal and cannot be taken as a description of what is actually
happening.</em></p>

<p>A December 2020 article in USA Today lays out the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/12/16/covid-19-vaccine-data-supply-chain-software-immunization-registry-tiberius/3879655001/">flow of information
on
immunizations</a>
and describes the same flow described in the chart above.</p>
<p>Let’s go through this information flow displayed in the figure above
from top to bottom.</p>
<div id="iis-immunization-information-systems" class="section level3">
<h3>IIS – Immunization Information Systems</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html">Immunization information
systems</a> are
designed to track immunizations of individuals. There are 64 of them,
one for each state and territory plus some quirks such as New York City
being separate from New York State. These systems were primarily aimed
at childhood immunizations but always covered other immunizations as
well, which is why I can see many of my non-COVID vaccinations in CT
WiZ. National promotion of a an IIS architecture seems to have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/functional-standards/func-stds-2013-2018.html">started
around
2013</a>.
I assume this may have something to do with the Affordable Care Act
either directly or indirectly. The ACA covered some adult vaccines as
part of preventive services. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/core-data-elements/historical.html">Earlier
efforts</a>
to design the elements for such systems go back earlier to the 1990’s.</p>
</div>
<div id="iz-gateway" class="section level3">
<h3>IZ Gateway</h3>
<p>The CDC vaccine information architecture depends on 64 Immunization
Information Systems (IIS), which are mostly state based. The concept of
immunization gateway was <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/how-hhs-innovating-data-aggregation-and-visualization-boost-pop-health">developed before
COVID</a>
as a way to foster communication among the separate IIS’s.</p>
<p>The plan describes a lot of detail about the legal process. It discusses
the need for separate <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/iz-gateway/gateway-qa.html">explicit legal
agreements</a>
for how data goes from federal providers (such as DOD) to the state (via
its IIS).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Connect component of the IZ Gateway, will participating IISs
receive data (push) from VAMS and other non-traditional vaccination
providers (e.g., DOD) who administered vaccinations within the IIS’s
jurisdiction?</p>
<p>Yes, in the Connect component of IZ Gateway, participating IISs will
receive data from VAMS for patients in their jurisdictions.
Participating IISs will also receive data for patients in their
jurisdictions from non-traditional vaccination providers that are
onboarded to IZ Gateway Connect and not already connected to IISs.</p>
<p>How does provider-initiated multijurisdictional data exchange work?</p>
<p>The Provider-Initiated Multijurisdictional Data Exchange component of
IZ Gateway allows providers to initiate a query for immunization
information from multiple jurisdictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The theory is that the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/iz-gateway/information-sheet.html" title="Immunization Gateway information sheet">IZ
Gateway</a>
is a central hub through which data can move back and forth among the
various state-based IIS’s. The IZ Gateway is owned by CDC and hosted by
the <a href="https://www.aphl.org">Association of Public Health Laboratories</a>
(APHL). There is a
<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/immunization-flyer.pdf">flyer</a>
on the HHS site that seems to describe the idea of the gateway
pre-COVID.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HHS’ Immunization Gateway, meanwhile, which was launched in 2013 to
boost consumer access to immunization records and enable more informed
patient decisions, has helped improve population health by breaking
down silos and filling in critical missing pieces. [from a pre-COVID
<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/how-hhs-innovating-data-aggregation-and-visualization-boost-pop-health" title="from Healthcare IT News">press
report</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is actually happening with the gateway?</p>
<p>The diagram shows a lot of two-way arrows. In this post I am interested
in aggregate statistics reported by Connecticut and the CDC. But the IZ
Gateway is primarily oriented toward supporting immunization care of
individuals. It is a switchboard to direct queries about the
immunization record of an individual among multiple state IIS’s and
providers in order to support effective care of that individual.
Providing for statistical information is not its principal focus.</p>
<p>For participating states<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, all of the immunization data assembled by
the state IIS can flow through the IZ Gateway. Data for aggregates does
not flow so freely back down to the state. It seems that data for
Connecticut residents who get their vaccinations out of state does not
automatically flow into CT WiZ (the Connecticut IIS). One must also keep
in mind that individuals may list a local residence when they are
vaccinated. For states that have signed the relevant memorandum of
understanding, they can retrieve all of the immunizations for that
individual from the IZ Gateway. In that way, Connecticut may be able to
check whether a particular person has gotten vaccinations in another
state. I’m not sure whether that actually happens. It appears that
states IIS’s do not get statistics about out of state vaccinations of
their residents<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The planning diagram has lots of multi-way arrows, but the arrows may
represent individual health records rather than aggregate statistical
data. That limits the comprehensiveness of the reporting done by state
agencies such as the CT Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>There is an organization called the <a href="https://www.immregistries.org">American Immunization Registry
Association</a> (AIRA) which has been
involved in working out the legal memoranda of understanding that enable
the data exchange. There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMmvkEtvWw4" title="training video on IZ Gateway">training webinar from the summer of
2020</a>
that goes into some of the detail of those arrangements.</p>
<p>The IZ Gateway is operated by the Association of Public Health
Laboratories (APHL). The diagram below is a summary of their overview of
the gateway.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aphl.org/programs/informatics/Pages/aims_platform.aspx"><img src="https://www.aphl.org/PublishingImages/INFO-2020-AIMS-COVID-19-Data-Flow-Infographic.jpg" class="ms-rtePosition-2" alt="COVID-19 Data Flow on AIMS Platform" style="margin:10px 15px;" width="495" height="387" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the CDC information on the IZ Gateway doesn’t seem to jive with
actual practice. For example, their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/iz-gateway/questions-answers.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Freporting%2Fiz-gateway%2Fgateway-qa.html">Q&amp;A on the IZ
Gateway</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Share component, the IZ Gateway will recognize when a patient
is vaccinated outside of the jurisdiction in which he or she resides
and will automatically push the patient’s record to the relevant IIS.
By opting into IZ Gateway Share, a jurisdiction is automatically
choosing to share data, when relevant, with all participating IISs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on scanning various state web sites I haven’t seen signs that this
is what actually happens. It’s hard to say exactly. Identifying “the
jurisdiction in which he or she resides” may not be so simple for
snowbirds or college students.</p>
<p>The states that I have examined all have mentioned that the state IIS
(and therefore the state summary stats) do not contain information about
vaccinations administered by federal entities. That’s not what the Q&amp;A
on the CDC site seems to say:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="in-the-connect-component-of-the-iz-gateway-will-participating-iiss-receive-data-push-from-vams-and-other-non-traditional-vaccination-providers-e.g.-dod-who-administered-vaccinations-within-the-iiss-jurisdiction"><strong>In the Connect component of the IZ Gateway, will participating IISs receive data (push) from VAMS and other non-traditional vaccination providers (e.g., DoD) who administered vaccinations within the IIS’s jurisdiction?</strong></h5>
<p>Yes, in the Connect component of IZ Gateway, participating IISs will
receive data from VAMS for patients in their jurisdictions.
Participating IISs will also receive data for patients in their
jurisdictions from non-traditional vaccination providers that are
onboarded to IZ Gateway Connect and not already connected to IISs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vaccinations by federal agencies are recorded via VAMS. That data is
supposed to go into through the IZ Gateway but does not seem to be
passed on to the state IIS’s. State dashboards frequently mention that
vaccinations by federal entities are not included in their state
reporting. I don’t know why vaccinations by federal entities are not fed
into state IIS’s the same way as vaccinations by large pharmacy chains.</p>
<p>While the IZ Gateway was conceived before COVID, the pandemic increased
the urgency. An article “<a href="https://qz.com/1941989/how-the-us-plans-to-track-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-doses/">How the US plans to track Covid-19 vaccine
doses</a>”
describes some of the atmosphere in December 2020 just as vaccines were
about to be rolled out. It may just take time for the IZ Gateway to
reach its original conception.</p>
<p>The legal underpinning for exchanging data among states and with the CDC
depends on a complicated set of state-by-state legal agreements. The
best source I have on the IZ Gateway is a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMmvkEtvWw4">webinar</a> from 2020. The IZ
Gateway seems not to be a national immunization database. Rather, it is
a messaging system that routes communications among vaccine providers
and state IIS’s. It is oriented toward supporting medical treatment of
individuals (e.g., has an individual completed a vaccination series)
rather than providing aggregate public health information about
community immunization rates. For example, providing the federal
vaccination data to the states seems like a basic service that the IZ
Gateway should provide, but it doesn’t seem to be happening. My
impression is that a state might be able to query the immunization for
an particular individual who was immunized through a VA facility, but it
is not getting a bulk load of all the immunizations provided by VA and
other federal facilities in the jurisdiction of the state IIS.</p>
<div id="how-does-this-affect-connecticut-dph-reporting" class="section level5">
<h5>How does this affect Connecticut DPH reporting?</h5>
<p>The two big problems for Connecticut state reporting are that they do
not have complete information about vaccinations performed by federal
entities (notably the VA and DOD) and they do not learn about shots
given to Connecticut residents while in other states. The Gateway does
not seem to be helping with those issues. Also, within Connecticut,
college students may be counted in the denominator of the town where
live while at college but may be in the numerator according to the town
they listed as residence when we they got a shot.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="cdc-iz-clearinghouse" class="section level3">
<h3>CDC IZ Clearinghouse</h3>
<p>The Clearinghouse is described in the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/overview/IT-systems.html">CDC
summary</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The COVID-19 Data Clearinghouse is a cloud-hosted data repository that
receives, deduplicates, and deidentifies COVID-19 vaccination data
that are then used to populate the IZ Data Lake with deidentified data
for analytics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key phrase is “deduplicates and deidentifies COVID-19 vaccination
data.” The issue is whether that deduplication process is accurate and
effective. Compared with the state IIS data the CDC is reporting too
many people who are getting their first shot, presumably because they
have not identified in their clearinghouse that the same person had
gotten a shot previously. As an outsider it is impossible to fully
evaluate this situation.</p>
<p>There is a longer description of the IZ Clearinghouse in a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11584">January 2021
report from the Congressional Research
Service</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limitations with cross-jurisdictional immunization data sharing have
affected prior public health emergency responses. To address this,
some personally identifiable information (PII) on recipients is to be
collected, encrypted, and secured in CDC’s IZ Data Clearinghouse to
enable data sharing between jurisdictions and federal agencies through
the IZ Gateway. (CDC typically collects de-identified data. PII held
by CDC and other federal agencies is generally subject to the Privacy
Act of 1974 [5 U.S.C. §552a]). Submitted data are encrypted with
“privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL),” where PII is redacted and
replaced with unique tokens that allow for records sharing without
PII.</p>
<p>State and territorial public health officials have expressed concern
that “many states have laws prohibiting or limiting data sharing with
other entities, including the federal government.” As communicated to
CRS by CDC, all 64 jurisdictions have signed data-sharing agreements
with CDC that respond to jurisdictions’ unique concerns; CDC is still
in the process of rolling out PPRL, and it has not been implemented in
jurisdictions at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cdc-ncird-immunization-datalake-and-data-storefront-izdl.pdf">HHS privacy impact
assessment</a>
that describes issues with the identifiable data in the Clearinghouse
and the legal authorization for that information.</p>
</div>
<div id="cdc-iz-data-lake" class="section level3">
<h3>CDC IZ Data Lake</h3>
<p>The component that I have the least information about is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/overview/IT-systems.html">CDC IZ
Data
Lake</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IZ Data Lake is a cloud-hosted data repository to receive, store,
manage, and analyze deidentified COVID-19 vaccination data. CDC,
jurisdictions, federal agencies, and pharmacy partners uses the IZ
Data Lake to store and process administration, coverage, logistics,
inventory, ordering, distribution, and provider data. VAMS, IISs,
pharmacies, VTrckS, and Vaccines.gov will provide data for the IZ Data
Lake. The IZ Data Lake also aggregates and analyzes data and provides
data summaries and analytics via these reporting hubs</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="issues-with-cdc-covid-vaccination-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3>Issues with CDC COVID Vaccination Statistics</h3>
<p>The vaccination statistics are tabulated from the CDC Data Lake. The
quality of those statistics is constrained by how well the process of
deidentification and deduplication is applied to the source data before
is is transferred from the Clearinghouse to the Data Lake. The CDC’s
note quoted at the top of this post indicates that there are problems
with this step.</p>
<p>Another issue for the CDC is whether they are getting complete
information from an IIS in each state. I have focused on Connecticut,
and I’m confident that Connecticut is not a problem for the CDC. Based
on some superficial reading, I gather that there are some states that do
not feed complete information into the IZ Gateway and therefore the CDC
would have a less complete view of vaccinations in those states.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="is-there-a-trade-off-between-privacy-protection-and-accurate-vaccination-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2>Is There a Trade Off Between Privacy Protection and Accurate Vaccination Statistics</h2>
<p>A key issue is the attempt to ensure privacy of individual vaccination
data by deidentifying the data before it goes into the CDC Data Lake.
This step seems to have degraded the statistics. But does it do much to
improve privacy protection? Note that CDC is never publishing individual
level data. The deidentification step protects the data only from people
who have access to the CDC Data Lake. Probably that’s not a large group
of CDC staff. Meanwhile there are also some CDC staff who have access to
the CDC IZ Clearinghouse. And there is widespread access to the
state-based data through the individual Immunization Information
Systems. It seems likely that deidentification does not significantly
reduce the number of individual with access to the data who might
violate their confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whether or not data is individually identifiable is not what
really keeps the data private. For practical reasons, immunization
systems and other health delivery systems have to deal with individually
identifiable data in order to support medical treatment of individuals.
What privacy actually depends on is ethical and increasingly legal rules
determining what information may not be revealed.</p>
<p>So it is the <em>confidentiality</em> of the data that provides the real
protection of privacy, not <em>anonymity</em>. That’s why <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html">Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA)</a> has
become such a feature of modern life. HIPPA makes confidentiality a
legal requirement. In the context of the overall privacy of immunization
records, the CDC’s deidentification step seems to function in a way
similar to what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier">Bruce
Schneier</a> has called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater">security theater</a>. In
this case it might be called privacy theater. It represents a visible
action related to privacy that doesn’t actually do much to increase
privacy. One of a small number CDC staff with access to the data
violating legal and CDC regulations to reveal an individual’s
vaccination record is not a high probability threat, especially in
comparison with all the other ways that information might be revealed.
We should remember how effective confidentiality rules can be. For
example, the IRS accumulates vast trove of individually identified
financial data. We have been watching for years as various people
attempt to get Donald Trump’s tax records from the IRS. The
confidentiality rules have held up under very great pressure.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cdc-ncird-immunization-datalake-and-data-storefront-izdl.pdf">HHS Privacy
Assessment</a>
that describes in detailed legal restrictions on the data that goes from
state IIS’s into the central system. This includes information that
identifies individuals such as name, date of birth, and contact
information. Note that the privacy assessment refers to the “Data Lake.”</p>
<p>Note that the authority
(<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/20/2020-15564/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records" title="SORN from Federal Register">09-90-2001</a>)
cited in the HHS Privacy Assessment was written in the summer of 2020
specifically to respond to the COVID epidemic.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/us/politics/cdc-vaccine-data-privacy.html">New York Times
article</a>
from December 2020 describes concerns and suspicion about why the
federal government was asking for individual identifying information for
the IZ Gateway. It’s possible that deidentification is responding to
those political concerns. The CDC is saying, “don’t worry, we don’t have
the data for a vaccine ID card.” But they do have the data. It’s just in
the IZ Clearinghouse rather than in the Data Lake.</p>
</div>
<div id="issues-that-affect-both-cdc-and-state-vaccination-rates" class="section level2">
<h2>Issues That Affect Both CDC and State Vaccination Rates</h2>
<p>An issue for vaccination rates by geographic area is that the residence
reported at the time of vaccination may not be the same residence
reported to the Census tabulations which drives the denominator of the
rate calculation. College students, “snowbird” retirees who spend part
of the year in different states, or migrant workers may not be counted
consistently in the numerator and the denominator. When someone gets a
vaccination they are most likely to give their location at the time of
the vaccination as their residence. That may not be the same place the
individual is counted in the 2020 census.</p>
<p>For example, the town of Mansfield is the home of the University of
Connecticut. It has the lowest reported vaccination rate of any town in
Connecticut. In the Census, students who live on campus are counted as
residents of Mansfield and are in the denominator of the rate
calculation. At the time they were vaccinated many of those students may
have reported their home address as the address where they live with
their families when school is not in session. Younger populations are
less likely to be vaccinated, but a large part of what produces the
reported low vaccination rate in Mansfield is that “home address” in the
vaccination data often does not match where the student was counted by
the Census Bureau.</p>
</div>
<div id="comparison-with-polling-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Comparison with Polling Data</h2>
<p>There are many opinion polls that ask about COVID vaccination.
Unfortunately polling questions often do not distinguish among first
dose, second dose, and booster dose. Pew has published a
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/20/polls-on-covid-19-vaccination-closely-align-with-cdc-data/">report</a>
that compares many public opinion polls with CDC reports. The report
focus on the percentage of adults who have received at least one dose so
it does not evaluate question of whether subsequent doses are being
accurately reported. In general it shows that polls closely track CDC
data so that’s reassuring. The report only goes up through June 2021
which means it stopped before booster shots became an option. The report
provides some reassurance that the CDC data and polling data agree.
Right now the main concern with the CDC vaccine stats is related to
whether they are accurately tracking booster doses. It will be
interesting to see whether this holds up as multiple booster shots
become more common.</p>

<h2>General Issues with Tracking COVID Data</h2>
<p>There have been significant issues surrounding data quality throughout
the COVID pandemic. In 2020 the <a href="https://covidtracking.com">COVID Tracking
Project</a> emerged from multiple efforts to try
to obtain comparable statistics about the path of the epidemic in the
United States. It was a volunteer effort and suspended operation in
March 2021 at a point when they felt the data could be obtained from
<a href="https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/federal-covid-data-101-how-to-find-data">federal
sources</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2022 Bob Wachter did an interesting interview with Eric Topol
that reviewed the state of pandemic at that moment. Near the end of the
interview, there’s an interesting section where BW asks about why the US
seems to need to rely on data from other countries. Here is a transcript
of that portion of the interview (which starts at 48:03 on the YouTube
video):</p>
<p>The Omicron Whirlwind: A Conversation with Eric Topol about the Current
and Future State of the Pandemic January 13, 2022 Bob Wachter
interviewing Eric Topol Bob Wachter is Chair, UCSF Department of
Medicine. Eric Topol is a cardiologist and founder and director of the
Scripps Research Institute</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BW: That’s a good pivot to something you were beginning to talk about
but I sort of moved it along, but let’s get back to it. Up until two
years ago, you’d see a paper in a journal and it was from UK or from
Israel or from South Africa, you’d say, ‘Oh, that’s not America. I’m
waiting for the study.’ Whereas for the last two years, it seems like
almost all of the insights, or many of them, come from studies from
other countries. They have better data systems, they are investing
more in clinical research. What’s going on and what do we need to do
to be leaders in this area? Because it really feels like we’re
followers.</p>
<p>ET: We are followers. And we have pathetic data systems. I mean,
pathetic. And the one thing that really strikes me, Bob, is that we of
course support the current administration and the fact that the mantra
sticking to the science. But there has been all these announcements
from day one of taking on administration through today, there has not
been one mention of improving our data system. Not a mention. And this
is just preposterous. Yes, we are forced to rely on other country’s
data, but when these advisory committees for FDA and CDC convene, they
basically are unwilling to accept that data even though there’s not
data here in this country, because, like for example, right now we
want to know whether these Omicron boosters, how well they’re working
to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. And when do they wane? When
does their protection wane? Those people who are getting hospitalized
who had a third shot, what’s going on there? We were promised by the
CDC in May that they would track every breakthrough hospitalization
and death. Never happened. And so we don’t have critical data. We have
150,000-plus people in the hospital. And I have begged at the HHS
level that we have granular data on each of those people. Their
vaccination status, which vaccine, when they got it, their age, their
co-existing conditions, and all the basal stuff, right? And they say,
“Well, we’re gonna look into it.” Even though it can be mandated by
HHS authority. So we have just a dreadful situation here where we
don’t have real-time capture of data. The only data that gets posted
on the CDC is a month old, and it’s de minimus about things like
hospitalizations or deaths, and this is unacceptable. If you’re gonna
go in a pandemic and try to deliver and guidance, you have to have
data. That’s how you develop trust. That’s how you have the best
navigation system. And we don’t have it. But the most important thing
to me, Bob, is there’s no seeming will to get one. And that is
distressing and it has to change.</p>
<p>BW: Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>ET: Well, the main thing to me is that we have a Secretary of HHS, who
came from California, the attorney general, he hasn’t shown up for the
pandemic. Have you seen him? Have you seen him make a statement?</p>
<p>BW: I saw him talking about how the CDC director doesn’t have a degree
in marketing the other day. That was interesting.</p>
<p>ET: I see, I see, Yeah we have a serious problem. HHS, there’s been a
lot of infighting between the agencies. And the HHS secretary should
be bringing that together. And so we have a serious problem is we have
a no-show HHS secretary. We have an HHS that could mandate this data
capture, but they’re afraid, in my view, of political backlash. That’s
why they’re not doing it. And you just can’t. Yeah, we’re a big
country, but yo know what, a big country without data is in a horrible
situation. So we have to rely on other countries. And fortunately we
have amazing data that comes out of places like the UK and Israel and
Denmark and South Africa. So many that has been terrific for us. But
it’s amazing we have a different population here, we’re much less
vaccinated, much less boosted, we have lots of co-existing conditions
that are not as prevalent in some of these other countries, and yet we
don’t have data. I don’t know. I mean, I just don’t think that the
administration has delivered to sticking to the science because part
of the science is having the data.</p>
<p>BW: Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>After diving deep into various reports and web sites I still have
questions about now vaccinations are being tabulated.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Why don’t vaccinations by federal entities (e.g., VA or DOD) go into
the state Immunization Information Systems? It constitutes a major
hole in the state public health department reporting.</li>
<li>Is CDC making a sustained effort to tie together vaccinations
administered to a single individual? Deidentification by itself
doesn’t cause a problem for the stats. But deidentification makes it
harder to explore and correct weakness in the data caused by
uncertainty about whether a shot is a new immunization or a
subsequent dose give to the same individual.</li>
<li>Is there more that could be done for state Immunization Information
Systems to add more information about shots that were administered
in other states?</li>
<li>How is the CDC reporting system going to cope with a likely
situation where what we want to track is whether an individuals
COVID immunizations are “complete and up to date” as the definition
of “complete and up to date” develops over time? We seem to be close
to a point where what we want to know is whether an individual has
had a booster within the last four months (or some other term). This
puts even more pressure on the need to follow immunization history
of individuals even if they have gotten vaccinations in multiple
states.</li>
