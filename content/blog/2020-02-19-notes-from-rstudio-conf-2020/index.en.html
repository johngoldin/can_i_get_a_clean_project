<h2>Links To a Few of the Sessions</h2>
<p>I enjoyed attending the RStudio Conference in San Francisco January 29th and 30th. I also attended
the Tidyverse developer day on the Friday after the conference and did my first Pull Request (PR).
Soon I will be able to type <code>?forcats::fct_reorder</code> and see my own super-simple example added to
the help for that function.</p>
<p>The videos from the conference are now <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020">online</a>. It’s
impressive how much video content RStudio has online at their <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com">resources site</a>
including video from all the past conferences. There’s a lot of useful stuff there.</p>
<p>My favorite talk of the conference was the <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/rstudio-open-source-software-for-data-science-j-j-allaire">keynote by J. J. Allaire</a>, the co-founder of RStudio.
It was relevant for the world way beyond R and RStudio. Starting at about minute 25 he gets
into issues about the motivation and incentives of for-profit corporations.
He gets deeply into the issues. One does not expect to see a slide with the title
“Dodge v. Ford Motors (1919)” at a computer conference. The subject that
is addressing is relevant way beyond the computer industry. RStudio is a fascinating company
and J.J.’s talk made it clear how much of the personality of the company comes directly
from its founder.</p>
<p>The other Wednesday morning keynote was also excelent. Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg
of Google delivered a very polished and interesting talk on <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/data-visualization-and-designing-ai-fernanda-viegas-and-martin-wattenberg">Data, Visualization, and
Designing with AI</a>. It got into the topic of issue of what “fair” and “biased” mean
in the context of machine learning based decision algorithms.</p>
<p>Some other talks I enjoyed:</p>
<p>A talk on the <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/3d-ggplots-with-rayshader-dr-tyler-morgan-wall">rayshader package</a>
had a lot of graphical “Wow!”.</p>
<p>I enjoyed William Chase on <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/the-glamour-of-graphics-william-chase">The Glamour of Graphics</a>.</p>
<p>There were several heavy duty sessions on sports analytics including <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/putting-the-fun-in-functional-data-a-tidy-pipeline-to-identify-routes-in-nfl-tracking-data-dani-chu">this one</a>
on NFL route tracking. And see <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/r-tidyverse-in-sports-namita-nandakumar">this one</a> as well.</p>
<p>I always find talks by Jenny Bryan to be very rewarding. She’s my go-to source for miscellaneous practical tips
on a number of R subjects I care about, such as her <a href="https://happygitwithr.com">Happy Git book</a> and <a href="https://rstats.wtf">What They Forgot to Teach You About R</a>.
The title of her talk was
<a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable-jenny-bryan">Object of type ‘closure’ is not subsettable</a>,
a message that every R coder encounters eventually. The talk addressed how to debug R code.</p>
<p>Because many sessions were presented in four parallel tracks, I want to go back and watch some of the sessions I missed
such as <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/lightning-talk-dr-amelia-mcnamara">Making a tidy dress</a> by Dr. Amelia McNamara.</p>
<p>Of course there were lots of sessions and not all of them were great. But there was a lot of good content.</p>
