<p>During the last several years I have been accumulating various notes while I explore the Apple Health Export.
This post will be a series of disconnected comments. I’ll be adding to it during the
weeks before and after my talk at RConf2022.</p>
<p>The schedule for the 2022 RStudio conference is <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/2022/schedule/">here</a>.
<a href="https://rstudioconf2022.sched.com/?iframe=yes&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no#">My talk</a>
is at 11:30 on Thursday, July 28.</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="RConf2022_health_export_slides.html">slides</a> for my talk,
done as a Quarto presentation.</p>
<p>To learn how to get the Apple Health Export and load it into R, see my

<div id="the-big-picture" class="section level3">
<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>Dr. Sumbul Desai is Apple’s Vice President for Health, which
makes her the spokesperson for the importance of the Apple Health Kit and
the health data collected by the Watch and the iPhone. In an interview
in February of 2022, Dr. Desai emphasized quote from
Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, which stakes out an ambitious claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you zoom out into the future and you look back and you ask the question what was Apple’s greatest contribution to mankind, it will be about health. [at 2:05 in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/02/21/apple-vp-health-shares-how-it-designs-health-features/">this interview</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a bold statement. Apple has a long way to go to match that aspiration.</p>
<p>In May of 2022, David Pogue did a fun
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyV7a60p52o">interview with Dr. Desai</a>
on CBS Sunday Morning that makes
the case for the Health app. They spend some time on detection of atrial fibrillation,
and I’ll have much more to say on that topic below. The electro-cardiogram seems to
be on a different level of sophistication on than the other measures taken
by the Apple Watch. Perhaps that’s wrong-headed. For all I know, the machine learning
required to reliably do fall detection or to measure walking unsteadiness may
be more complex than what’s required to identify atrial fibrillation from the ECG.
But understandably Apple emphasize atrial fibrillation because it’s the most
dramatic example of a direct connection between the Apple Watch and medical
treatment.</p>
<p>The segment also includes an interview with Dr. Michael Snyder, a professor at the Stanford Medical School.
Snyder’s topic is closer to the near term uses of the Apple Health Kit. He hopes to
use health tracking to identify what’s “normal” for an individual so that one
can detect changes that indicate that something now is not normal and intervention
may be useful. Easier said than done. He talks about using health tracking to
support early detection of COVID infection. Snyder did a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d70Wm_-JDcA">TEDx talk on wearables</a>
all the way back in 2015.
His point: “You don’t run your car without a dashboard. Here we are as people running around without any sensors most people and we should be wearing these things in my opinion because they can alert to early things.”</p>
<div id="large-scale-studies-using-the-apple-health-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Large Scale Studies Using the Apple Health Data</h4>
<p>I’m optimistic about what large scale studies might be able to find. The
Apple iOS for the iPhone includes the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/research-app/">Research</a> app.
The Research app is intended to facilitate large-scale studies that
make use of the collected in the Apple Health Kit, the database that
supports the Health app.
I participate in the Apple Heart and Movement Study. The Research app is intended
to support sharing of health data with a research project in a way that also protects the privacy
of the data. So far the list of open studies looks underwhelming.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/03/apple-heart-study-demonstrates-ability-of-wearable-technology.html">Apple Heart Study</a>
has been completed and may serve as an example of how such studies can work.</p>
<p>There is also competition for the Apple Research app. <a href="https://careevolution.com/mydatahelps-research-wellness-platform/">MyDataHelps</a>
is a platform independent app that also manages collection of data from
tracking to support research studies.
I’m enrolled in the DETECT study by Scripps Research which is intended to
see whether heart rate, activity, and sleep measured by my tracker
can predict when someone is coming down with a viral illness even before
they feel bad.</p>
<p>In the spirit of writing these notes, I just signed up for
<a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com">Project Baseline</a>
which appears to be the equivalent app created by Google.</p>
<p>A friend of mine is enrolled in the Johnson &amp; Johnson <a href="https://heartlinestudy.com">Heartline Study</a>. This study is looking at
screening for atrial fibrillation. He was able to buy an Apple
Watch at a reduced price to enter the study. (Otherwise they
would have loaned him a watch.) I was not able to join this
study because I have been previously diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>I think these kinds of studies have a future. The most obvious
places where they will be conclusive is the relationship between
fitness and health. What trackers are really good at is
measuring movement and heart rate. There’s a potential for studies
that make very precise connections between intensity of physical
activity and health. It may take longer for them to be effective
in other areas.</p>
<p>One problem with using Apple Watch data as the basis for research is
that the measures are a “black box.” Apple is not forthcoming about
the operational definition of the measures (i.e., what exactly are they
doing) or whether the measures are changed. It’s a good thing that
Apple makes changes in order to improve their measures. It’s a problem
for researchers if they don’t know those changes are happening.
There is an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594178/apple-watch-data-research-heart-rate-reliability">article in The Verge</a>
that describes an example of the problem.</p>
<p>While looking for information on Apple Watch studies, I also
came across <a href="https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/health-tech/apple-watch-study-provides-an-unprecedented-look-at-health-status-of-a-diverse-patient">reports of early results</a> from a study at
the University of Michigan.</p>

<div id="privacy" class="section level3">
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>The Apple Health Kit is a moment by moment recording of your life. It has obvious
implications for privacy. I may be the wrong person to evaluate the risks.
As I look at my Health Export data, I do so wrapped in a cocoon of
privilege that protects me from many of the potential consequences.
I’m old enough that my future is limited. As a financially comfortable
retiree I’m unlikely to apply for a job, unlikely to run for office,
unlikely to encounter law enforcement or the criminal justice system.
Perhaps some day Health Kit data could be used to question whether I
should continue to have a license to drive. (And maybe that would be an appropriate
use.)</p>
<p>In general I don’t feel like there’s much potential for
adverse consequences for me personally. But I may not be typical.
In the wake of the Supreme Court decision
overturning Roe v. Wade there has been much discussion of how cycle
tracking in health apps could be used to expose women to prosecution.
That’s not far fetched. January 6 rioters were tracked in part via their phone,
but one can image that minute by minute heart rate data might also
relate to their activities during the event. What could Communist China
do with the Health Export data? It takes the invasion of privacy
imagined in <strong>1984</strong> to another level.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that privacy of health and fitness tracking is a serious
issue. But you shouldn’t look to me for a lot of wisdom on that aspect
of tracking. I’ve already made a choice and immersed myself in tracking.
It works for me, but my situation would not apply to everybody.</p>
<p>One practical issue is that if you use the Apple Health Export you should
pay attention to where the exported folder ends up. Once you have
extracted the data from the Apple Health app, it becomes your
responsibility rather than Apple’s to limit whether anyone else can
access it.</p>

<h3>A Bit More on the Nuts and Bolts of the Apple Health Export</h3>
<p>The export from the Health app comes as a zip file called export.zip.</p>
<p>When I unzip export.zip I get an apple_health_export
folder containing the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>apple_health_export (3.8 GB)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>electrocardiograms [folder] (37 MB)</p></li>
<li><p>export_cda.xml (851 MB)</p></li>
<li><p>workout-routes [folder] (1.3 GB)</p></li>
<li><p>export.xml (1.7 GB) &lt;– the part I use</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I always make sure I unzip this in my Downloads folder, which
is excluded from my Time Machine backup. I don’t want to clutter
up my backup with all these gigabytes of stuff. (But see my
comment above on why you should be aware who has access to this folder.)</p>
<p>My first post has more detail on getting the export.</p>
<p>Below is a fragment of the code I use to do the
actual import of the data from export.xml.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  if (file_exists(&quot;~/Downloads/export 2.zip&quot;)) usethis::ui_stop(&quot;More than one version of export zip.&quot;)
  if (file_exists(&quot;~/Downloads/export.zip&quot;)) {
    rc &lt;- unzip(&quot;~/Downloads/export.zip&quot;, exdir = &quot;~/Downloads&quot;, overwrite = TRUE)  # exported folder is 2.75GB
    if (length(rc) != 0) {
      # once unzipped, delete export.zip. Otherwise, the next time Air Drop sends export.zip
      # to your mac it will be renamed as export2.zip and you may accidentally process
      # an out-of-date set of data.

      # takes a bit more than 20 seconds on my iMac
      health_xml &lt;- XML::xmlParse(&quot;~/Downloads/apple_health_export/export.xml&quot;)
      # takes about 70 seconds on my iMac
      health_df &lt;- XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame(health_xml[&quot;//Record&quot;], stringsAsFactors = FALSE) |&gt;
        as_tibble() |&gt; mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) |&gt;
        select(-device)  # device seems to cause some duplicate rows
      check_count &lt;- nrow(health_df)
      health_df &lt;- health_df |&gt; unique()   # unique adds at least two minutes. Had found 42,364 rows, mostly Lose It!, SleepMatic, and Omron, but some came from Watch and iPhone

      usethis::ui_info(&quot;Completed raw import, nrow(health_df): {usethis::ui_value(nrow(health_df))} &quot;)
    } else usethis::ui_stop(&quot;unzip returned a zero length list.&quot;)
  } else usethis::ui_warn(&quot;There was no export.zip file.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I have a bunch more code after this that does some basic setup of the data.</p>
<p>I realize I need to do a Github Gist to share this code.</p>

<div id="atrial-fibrillation-and-the-apple-watch" class="section level3">
<h3>Atrial Fibrillation and the Apple Watch</h3>
<p>Afib is strongly related to age. “Prevalence increased from 0.1% among adults younger than 55 years to 9.0% in persons aged 80 years or older.” [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11343485/">from a 2001 study</a>] Younger populations
should not worry too much about atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>Apple touts the value of widespread screening for Afib, but there are
sound reasons why that might not be a good thing.
Here’s the inconclusive statement from the <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/atrial-fibrillation-screening">US Preventitive Care Task Force</a>: “For adults 50 years or older who do not have signs or symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AF):
The USPSTF found that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF.”
Aaron Carroll, The Incidental Economist, has done a <a href="https://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/is-the-apple-watch-a-useful-medical-device/">video</a>
expressing skepticism about the value of the ECG feature of the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And for another skeptical note, see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/2/22958156/apple-watch-heart-rhythm-detection-benefit">this article</a>.</p>
<p>If you have symptoms, get it checked out. But if you don’t have symptoms, screening
for Afib may not be worthwhile, especially among non-elderly populations.</p>
<div id="apple-and-kardiamobile-from-alivecor" class="section level4">
<h4>Apple and KardiaMobile from AliveCor</h4>
<p>Note that in terms of personal detection of Afib, Apple has some significant
competition. A company called AliveCor makes a product called
<a href="https://store.kardia.com/products/kardiamobile">KardiaMobile</a>. I does an electro-cardiogram
in a way that is similar to the Apple Watch. You can pick one up on
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/KardiaMobile-Single-Lead-Personal-Monitor-FDA-Cleared/dp/B01A4W8AUK/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2X92WZQFQ9ZSE&amp;keywords=kardia+mobile+heart+monitor&amp;qid=1658170156&amp;sprefix=kardia%2Caps%2C76&amp;sr=8-5">Amazon</a> for about $79.
I just saw that there’s a
<a href="https://store.kardia.com/products/kardiamobile-card">new version</a>
called the KardiaMobile Card that is exactly the size of a
credit card, presumably so that it will fit into your wallet.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://theskepticalcardiologist.com/2020/09/27/apple-watch-versus-kardia-to-monitor-atrial-fibrillation-from-home-a-case-study/">Skeptical Cardiologist</a>
discusses the use of both KardiaMobile and Apple Watch in his practice.</p>
<p>AliveCor has been maybe six months ahead of AliveCor in terms of what they’ve
been able to detect with their software. When I had Afib in 2020, Apple’s
algorithm would not say anything beyond “inconclusive” if pulse was
higher than some level (I think only 110 or so.) AliveCor was doing better
at high pulse rate. Apple got FDA approval for their improved algorithm at the
end of 2020. AliveCor is now detecting some rhythm conditions other than
Afib that Apple doesn’t detect. So AliveCor seems to be legitimate competition.</p>
<p>AliveCor is <a href="https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/California_Northern_District_Court/3--21-cv-03958/Alivecor_Inc._v._Apple_Inc/1/">suing Apple</a>
for anti-trust actions in connection with
their competition with Apple. I’m in no position to judge
the legal merits of the lawsuit, but in moral terms they
seem to have a point. AliveCor had developed a watchband for the
Watch that would do an electro-cardiogram and they were selling that
before Apple announced their ECG option. Normally Apple is secretive
about future products, but AliveCor alleges that Apple pre-announced
their ECG product in order to squelch AliveCor’s watchband product.
Based on my limited reading, I have the impression that the KardiaMobile
has a good reputation among cardiologists.</p>

<div id="fda-approval" class="section level4">
<h4>FDA Approval</h4>
<p>I was curious what FDA approval of the Watch electrocardiogram looks like so
here is the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN180044.pdf">request for approval from the FDA</a>,
and here is the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/DEN180044.pdf">actual approval</a>.</p>
<p>The Verge did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance">an explanation</a> of why Apple needed FDA approval for the
electrocardiogram but did not get the pulse oximeter approved as a
medical device.</p>
<p><a href="https://gadgetanswer.com/top-6-fda-approved-ecg-smartwatch/">Here</a> is a
list of six FDA approvals of electrocardiogram features in Watches.</p>
