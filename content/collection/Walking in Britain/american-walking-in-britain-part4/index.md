## There are Lots of Aids to Navigation

For the official long-distance routes on the coast, navigation is mostly
easy. Just keep the ocean to your left 
(or right, depending on your general heading).
And yet on the first day of setting out from Padstow on
the South West Coast Path I managed to follow
a finger post that said "SWCP" that pointed in
the direction opposite from my intended direction.
It's hard to explain how I did that. I won't bore you
with a long paragraph on how I turned myself around.
The point is that it's possible to get off track.

My most important piece of advice is don't be over confident
and assume you know where you are. When in doubt, check.
You're on foot so if you start going in an incorrect direction it
can take you a long time to fix your mistake. Better to notice
quickly that you are off your intended route and do something
about it sooner rather than later. So how do you know where
you are and whether you are on track?

### Maps

The Ordnance Survey is the government organization that does 
maps for the UK. 
OS paper maps are widely available in bookstores and local shops.
The OS Explorer series is aimed at walkers. The scale is 
very tight: 4cm on the map is equal to 1km in the real world 
(a scale of 1:25000). 

A paper map at that scale turns out
to be fairly bulky and unweildy. I confess I have almost never
used the 1:25K scale OS maps. 
Instead on multi-day walks I have relied on [Harvey Maps](http://www.harveymaps.co.uk), 
whose slogan is "a good week's walking on one map".
Harvey maps are availble for the national trails and
other popular longer routes. The scale is 1:40K rather
than 1:25K. There's enough detail to find your way,
but it's easier to get the map unfolded so that you 
can see the spot you need. They are printed on
waterproof paper, a good feature for a map you plan
to need for a week.

There is also the OS Landranger series, which is
also useful for walks. At a 
scale of 1:50K you can see a much larger area for a given
size of paper. It's not as detailed as the 
Explorer maps, but it's generally good enough to help
you find your way. If you are spending a lot of time
in a location not covered by a Harvey map,
the Explorer maps are a good alternative.

#### Maps on Your Phone

One catch with using a paper map is that it's not
very useful unless you locate where you are on the 
map. One attractive feature of a map on your phone is
that the GPS can show you where you are on the map.

The Ordnance Survey offers access t their maps on Android or iPhone
via their OS Maps app. My most recent holiday in the UK
was in 2019 before this app was released
so I used other electronic aids,
primarily [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com)
on my iPhone and a Garmin GPS (or SatNav in Britspeak) 
loaded with Open Street Map for the UK obtained
via an outfit called [Talkytoaster](https://shop.talkytoaster.me.uk/product/tt-150k-look-n-feel-map-for-self-install-automatic-delivery-british-isles-only-dem).
For my next trip I expect to rely on the Ordnance Survey OS Maps app.
Access is by subscription, but you can get a 
one-month premium access for £3.99, which is a good deal.
By comparison, a single Landranger paper maps costs £8.99.

The app is mimics the appearance of the paper
Ordnance Survey maps. If you are looking at a wider
area, the format follows the Landranger series (where
the paper maps show a scale of 1:50K). As you zoom in,
the format changes to the Explorer maps (designed
for a scale of 1:25K).

Here are two screenshots of OS Maps dispaying the
area where the Two Moors Way passes through the town of
Ivybridge and enters Dartmoor. The first version shows
the Landranger style and the second zooms into a smaller area
and shows Explorer style. It's a bit disconcerting when
the style changes suddenly as one zooms in using the app, 
but it's not bothersome.

{{< figure src="img/Landranger Ivybridge.jpg#floatleft"

{{< figure src="img/Explorer Ivybridge.jpg"  
  width="300"
  caption="<font size=2>Explorer 1:25K</font>" >}}
  
Unfortunately the details of the legends are different
on the two separate map formats. For example, 
on Landranger a long distance trail such as the
Two Moors Way is marked as
a red diamond while on Explorer it appears as a
green diamond. On Landranger contour lines are in
red while on Explorer they are more of a brown color.
It's not too bad. Your brain will sort it out almost
automatically. 
  
The OS Maps app is designed to work with your account on the OS web
site. You can use the web version of the map on a large
screen computer to draw a route. That route is 
automatically available on an iPhone or Android that
is signed into the same Ordnance Survey account.

#### Don't Forget to Download!

You need to remember that using a map on your phone 
(such as the OS Maps app) works differently
depending on whether you are connected to the internet.
When connected you can move around the map freely to
look at different areas. But in the center of Dartmoor
or some other isolated spot, you can't rely on a cell
signal to connect you to the internet. Before you
venture out on a walk without internet access, 
you need to display the area
on the screen where you expect to walk and then use
the menu to explicitly download that map to your phone.
As a test, switch to airplane mode to disconnect from
the internet to verify that you can still see the map
for the area you need once you are out of cell phone coverage.

### Navigation the Old-Fashioned Way: Compass and Paper Map

The Ordnance Survey web site has an 
[introduction to compass and maps](https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/guides/beginners-guides-map-reading/). 
There's an [avanced](https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/guides/map-reading-skills-advanced-guides/) page as well.
There are many other resources on the web, 
but one advantage of the OS site is it is oriented toward the
specifics of the UK, Ordnance Survey maps, and the UK grid 
system used by OS maps.

### Using Your Phone as a Compass

Most smart phones can also serve as a compass. 
The iPhone comes with the [Compass app](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/compass-iph1ac0b663/ios).

There also is a free app from the Ordnance Survey called 
OS Locate (for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/os-locate/id810024913)
or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ordnancesurvey.oslocate.android&hl=en_US&gl=US)).
OS Locate will show your location in terms of standard
UK grid coordinates and can serve as a baseplate compass.

### Just in Case

#### Have a Backup

OS Maps and AllTrails and other GPS resources are great,
but always have a backup. Don't get into trouble because
you lose your phone or run out of battery. You should have
a compass and some sort of map as backup.

#### Where Am I and How To Communicate That To Someone Else

If you have a smart phone or a satnav device, GPS can tell
you where you are. You can specify a location in terms
of longitude and latitude. For example, in Google maps,
press and hold a spot on the map until you see "dropped pin"
at the bottom of the screen. Tap on the pin and you'll see a 
numerical value for latitude and longitude. That's where you 
are. 

But there's a catch. It turns the earth
is not a perfect sphere and as a result there are multiple systems for
mapping latitude and longitude to its imperfect shape.
Google Maps and GPS use a coordinate system called [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System).
The catch is the UK Ordnance Survey maps uses a UK-centric system
[OSGB36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid).

> In Cornwall, the WGS 84 longitude lines are about 70 metres east of their OSGB 36 equivalents, this value rising gradually to about 120 m east on the east coast of East Anglia. The WGS 84 latitude lines are about 70 m south of the OSGB 36 lines in South Cornwall, the difference diminishing to zero in the Scottish Borders, and then increasing to about 50 m north on the north coast of Scotland.

In case you want to nerd out on why there's more than one way
to map latitude and longitude to the earth's surface,
check this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum).

The upshot is that if you report your location to emergency service
via latitude and longitude from Google maps, they might
interpret that as being from the UK system. The difference
might be about the length of an American football field
so for emergency purposes, that's probably good enough. 

On the other hand, if you download waypoints for a guide
book that uses the UK system (OSGB36) and feed them
into something such as AllTrails that uses WGS84, you might
be looking for a bridge or a trail intersection that might
be 100 or so meters off from what you expected. It's something
to keep in mind. If you have a handheld satnav (such as from 
Garmin) there usually is a setting that let's you choose
what coordinate system you want to use.

#### OS Locate

In the UK people often communicate location in terms of the
grid reference system that is specific to the UK rather than using
latitude and longitude There's an app called [OS Locate](https://shop.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/apps/os-locate/) 
for iPhone and Android that will report your location in 
UK grid reference terms or in latitude and longitude
based on OSGB36.It also can be used as a compass.

## Ways You Can Go Wrong and How to Avoid Them

My most embarrassing navigation mistake happened on the Pennine Way.
It was raining so I was a bit buttoned up. I walked down the
path to a spot where it crossed a busy road. I stopped there for a
bit of a break and had a small snack and a drink. 
During my break, I somehow got
it into my head that I had crossed the road and just started up
the path. But I hadn't crossed the road so when I headed up the
path I was actually heading back in the direction I had come from.
I probably went almost a quarter of a mile before I checked my
GPS track and realized I was retracing my steps. 
Nagging doubt is your friend! Listen to it.
When in doubt, check!

Some of my difficult navigation experiences have
occurred while I was following a local route suggested
by a pamphlet from the local TIC (tourist informaiton center).
The local route may not be that heavily used and may
or may not have signs when you need. The crude hand
drawn map that may go along with a pamphlet like that
is not enough to keep you from getting lost. 
You need a good map or a good mapping app on your phone.

## Ordnance Survey

### Ordnance Survey Trig Points

On many high points one finds a concrete pillar that
marks one of the known points that make up the
[survey points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retriangulation_of_Great_Britain)
that anchor the maps created by the Ordance Survey.
Because the trip pillars are located at a high spot with
a good view, one generally feels a sense of accompishment
having reached one.


The [original version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_Triangulation_of_Great_Britain)
of the Ordnance Survey mapping
was done between 1791 and 1853.
